Instructional Designer (Department committee member reviewing final project design) is thinking...

[Response from gpt-4o-mini]: The proposed final project titled "AI for Social Good" provides a meaningful opportunity for students to demonstrate their mastery of the course objectives in a practical and engaging way. Below are some suggestions for refinements and enhancements that ensure clarity, promote inclusivity, facilitate scaffolding, and align with institutional policies.

### Clarity and Structure
1. **Detailed Rubrics**: Extend the rubrics to include examples or descriptions for each criterion in the assessment criteria. This will help students to better understand expectations and focus their efforts accordingly. For instance, under "Clarity" of the proposal, offer specific indicators of what constitutes clarity in their documentation.

2. **Clear Milestone Descriptions**: Ensure that each milestone includes specific guidelines on how to approach the task. This may include recommended structures for reports or examples of past projects that have successfully implemented similar methodologies.

### Scaffolding and Feedback Mechanisms
1. **Workshops for Proposal and Progress Reporting**: Before the proposal deadline, conduct a dedicated workshop where students can brainstorm problem areas, discuss potential methodologies, and collaborate with peers to refine their ideas. For the progress report, a mid-point check-in can be scheduled where students present their challenges and current progress informally to generate constructive peer feedback.

2. **Peer Review Process**: While a peer review is proposed post-proposal submission, consider making it iterative; for instance, introduce a feedback session after the proposal draft to allow teams to improve based on peer input before final submission.

3. **Instructor Check-Ins**: Schedule mandatory instructor check-ins after the proposal submission and before the final report. These sessions can serve as a checkpoint to gauge project direction and clarify any doubts—a chance for students to adapt their work based on instructor feedback proactively.

### Inclusivity and Collaborative Learning
1. **Diverse Team Formation Process**: Enhance the team formation guidelines by incorporating a more structured approach to ensure diverse skill sets. Consider creating a shared spreadsheet where students can indicate their strengths/interests, enabling intentional grouping based on complementary skills.

2. **Alternate Submission Formats**: Recognizing diverse learning styles, allow optional submission formats for parts of the project. For instance, students could give a video presentation or create an infographic summarizing their findings as an alternative to a traditional verbal presentation for certain project milestones.

3. **Resource Availability**: Provide students with access to additional resources, such as mentorship opportunities or consultations with professionals in the field. This could enhance their understanding of ethical implications and decision-making processes in real-world contexts.

### Fairness and Academic Integrity
1. **Ethics Workshop**: Organize a workshop focused entirely on the ethical implications of AI technologies, especially pertinent to their chosen projects. This creates a dedicated time for discussion, ensuring that the consideration of ethics is deeply embedded in their projects.

2. **Academic Integrity Reinforcement**: Clearly communicate consequences for violations of academic integrity within project guidelines and build checkpoints for team self-reflection to discuss collaborative processes and individual contributions.

### Workload Balance
1. **Schedule Announcements**: Early in the semester, provide a detailed timeline of the course along with all deadlines for assignments and project milestones. This assists students in planning their workload effectively.

2. **Catch-Up Resources**: Recognize that some students may struggle initially with project tasks related to coding or AI methodologies. Offer optional “catch-up” resources or lab sessions post-common assessments to reinforce foundational knowledge in programming or AI tools.

### Conclusion
The "AI for Social Good" project is well thought out, aligning closely with course objectives and student engagement principles. Implementing these suggestions could enhance clarity, promote effective feedback loops, and ensure a supportive learning environment for all students. Continuous evaluation of the process through student feedback will also ensure that the project remains dynamic and responsive to student needs throughout the course. Overall, this approach fosters not just knowledge acquisition but the development of critical thinking, collaboration, and ethical considerations essential for future AI practitioners.
