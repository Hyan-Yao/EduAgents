In particular, there is not much substance in many of the slides. Take lecture 3 as an example. The DP algorithms are not presented properly. Another example is lecture 9. There is NO substance in it."

The equations (1) and (2) are both wrong. The equations (6) and (7) use notion $G_t$ which is never defined. The symbol $R$ is used with various different meanings with no consistency. Similarly, in lecture 3, the symbol $R$ and $r$ are used interchangeably with no consistency."
