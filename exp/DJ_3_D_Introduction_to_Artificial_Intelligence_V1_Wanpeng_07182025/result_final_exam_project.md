# Final Project Plan Document

## Project Title: "AI for Social Good: Addressing Real-World Challenges"

### Project Overview
This final project replaces the traditional exam format by emphasizing collaborative and individual efforts to engage with real-world data and problems through the application of AI techniques.

---

### Project Objectives
1. **Problem Identification**: Choose a specific real-world challenge (e.g., healthcare access, climate change, bias in AI systems) to address using AI methodologies.
2. **AI Application**: Construct a methodology using AI techniques learned during the course to propose a solution for the chosen problem.
3. **Ethical Reflection**: Analyze the ethical implications of the AI application, considering issues like bias, privacy, and societal impact.
4. **Collaboration and Communication**: Develop skills in team collaboration, project management, and effective communication through presentations and reports.
