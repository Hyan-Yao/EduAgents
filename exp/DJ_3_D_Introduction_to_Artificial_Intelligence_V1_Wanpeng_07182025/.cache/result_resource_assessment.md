  - Proficient in programming languages such as Python.
  - Familiarity with AI frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
- **Ethics in AI**: Knowledge in addressing ethical implications surrounding AI technologies.

### 2. Necessary Computing Resources
- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - Classrooms must be equipped with high-performance computers that can run necessary AI software and data processing applications.
  - Students may need access to cloud computing resources for intensive computational tasks.
- **Software Requirements**:
  - **Programming Environments**: Access to tools such as Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook for Python programming.
  - **AI Libraries**: Ensure availability of TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch for practical project work.
  - **Additional Software**: Potential use of data analytics tools like R or MATLAB, contingent upon the course focus.

### 3. Scheduling Constraints
- **Course Duration and Frequency**: Design the schedule to provide:
  - Sufficient time allocation for theoretical instruction.
  - Opportunities for hands-on project work.
- **Availability of Faculty**: Faculty must be available for:
  - Scheduled class sessions.
  - Office hours for student support and queries.
- **Student Scheduling**: Ensure the course schedules do not conflict with core course requisites or popular electives to increase student enrollment.

### 4. Facility Limitations
- **Classroom Setup**:
  - Select technology-friendly classrooms equipped with computers or a laboratory environment conducive to collaborative project work.
- **Presentation Guidelines**: Adhere to a maximum slide count of 2 for presentations, necessitating concise and clear content delivery.
- **TA Support Availability**: Determine if teaching assistants will be available to support students during practical sessions and project work.

### 5. Additional Considerations
- **Student Background Requirements**: Clearly outline prerequisites and required skills for student enrollment to ensure capability in tackling course content.
- **Academic Integrity and Grading Policies**: The syllabus should align with institutional standards and clearly specify grading criteria and academic integrity expectations.

### Recommendations
1. **Align Course Pacing**: Adjust course pacing and content delivery to adequately cover fundamental concepts while facilitating coherence and alignment.
2. **Increase Hands-on Focus**: Integrate more practical assignments and project opportunities to meet learning objectives and enhance engagement.
3. **Refine Syllabus**: Ensure the syllabus conveys accessibility and transparency regarding resources, prerequisites, and institutional policies.
