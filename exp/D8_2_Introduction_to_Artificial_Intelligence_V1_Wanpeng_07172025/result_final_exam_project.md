# Final Project Plan: AI for Social Good

## Project Overview
The final project requires students to collaboratively identify and address a real-world problem using Artificial Intelligence methodologies, focusing on social impact areas such as healthcare, education, environmental sustainability, or public safety. Students will integrate knowledge from various fields and consider ethical implications while applying AI techniques to develop their solutions.

## Objectives
- Identify a significant social issue suitable for AI intervention.
- Apply appropriate AI methodologies and frameworks to develop solutions.
- Collaborate effectively in diverse teams.
- Analyze ethical considerations and implications of AI solutions.
