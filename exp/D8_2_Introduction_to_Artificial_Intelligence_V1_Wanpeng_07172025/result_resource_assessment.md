4. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge**:
   - Exposure or collaboration with experts in ethics, cognitive sciences, or application domains of AI (healthcare, finance).

## Necessary Computing Resources
1. **Classroom Technology**:
   - Computer lab or classroom with:
     - Individual workstations for students capable of running AI programming environments and simulations.
     - High-quality display tools (projector, whiteboard) for presentations.

2. **Software Requirements**:
   - Development environments (IDEs such as PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook).
   - Access to AI-specific libraries (NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
   - Simulation frameworks for hands-on exercises.

3. **Cloud Computing Resources**: 
   - Leverage platforms (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft Azure) to provide powerful computing resources without reliance on local hardware.

4. **Version Control Systems**:
   - Implement GitHub for collaborative coding practices, enhancing students' coding skills and project management experience.

5. **Learning Management System (LMS)**: 
   - Use of Canvas for course management, grading, and resource sharing, ensuring compliance with accessibility and academic integrity standards.

6. **Repository of Learning Resources**:
   - Establish a shared repository of educational materials that can be accessed easily by students via an online platform.

## Scheduling Constraints
1. **Class Duration and Format**: 
   - 75-minute in-person classes balancing lectures, labs, and interactive components.

2. **Flexible Lab Sessions**: 
   - Offer optional lab sessions at varying times to accommodate different student schedules.

3. **Teaching Assistant Support**:
   - Availability of a teaching assistant for additional support, planning around TA schedule to maximize availability for office hours.

4. **Monitoring Assignment Overlap**: 
   - Coordinate with other instructors to stagger major deadlines and minimize student workload during peak periods.

5. **Session Pacing**: 
   - Careful planning to ensure balanced progression of theory and hands-on practice throughout the semester.

## Facility Limitations
1. **Room Capacity**: 
   - Ensure the classroom capacity accommodates all enrolled students while allowing collaborative work space.

2. **Facility Availability**: 
   - Confirm availability of necessary classrooms and labs for scheduled course times across the term.

3. **Health and Safety Protocols**: 
   - Verify compliance with any applicable health considerations that may impact in-person attendance and classroom settings.

4. **Remote Learning Options**: 
   - Consider hybrid learning structures that provide live-streaming of lectures for students unable to attend in person.

## Compliance and Institutional Standards
1. **Academic Policies**:
   - Compliance with FIUâ€™s Academic Integrity Policy, accessibility requirements, and copyright regulations.
   - Clear communication of policies to students.

2. **Syllabus Requirements**:
   - Align syllabus with department expectations including learning outcomes, assessment criteria, and course schedule.

3. **Regular Audits**: 
   - Conduct regular reviews to ensure ongoing alignment with institutional standards regarding academic integrity and accessibility.

## Recommendations for Collaborating on Solutions
1. **Interdisciplinary Focus**: 
   - Form a working group within the department to promote interdisciplinary approaches to AI education and collaborative teaching.

2. **Feedback Mechanisms**: 
   - Develop continuous feedback loops through student surveys and informal check-ins to enhance the learning experience.

3. **Faculty Development Resources**: 
   - Provide access to professional development related to best practices in AI education, including workshops and collaborative bootcamps.

## Summary
The successful delivery of "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" demands a harmonious balance of qualified faculty, comprehensive technological resources, innovative scheduling strategies, and adherence to compliance standards. Addressing the detailed considerations outlined will facilitate a dynamic and effective educational environment for students.
