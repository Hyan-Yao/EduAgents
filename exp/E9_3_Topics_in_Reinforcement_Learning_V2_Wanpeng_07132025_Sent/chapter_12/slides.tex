        Reinforcement Learning is a subset of machine learning focused on how agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Challenge - Overfitting}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Overfitting occurs when an RL model learns noise and details in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts its performance on new data.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Causes}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Limited training data leading to excessive sensitivity.
            \item Complex models with too many parameters.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example}: An RL agent trained to play chess may excel in training games but struggle against new opponents.
        \item \textbf{Solutions}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Use regularization techniques to constrain model complexity.
            \item Augment the training data with varied scenarios.

    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Importance}: Striking the right balance is critical for achieving long-term success; excessive exploitation may hinder discovering better strategies.
        \item \textbf{Example}: In a recommendation system, an agent may exploit popular recommendations or explore less-known items.
        \item \textbf{Techniques}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Epsilon-Greedy Strategy: Choose a random action occasionally (exploration) while primarily selecting the best-known action (exploitation).
            \item Softmax Approach: Assign probabilities based on expected rewards to promote informed exploration.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Challenges}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Sparse rewards may not provide adequate guidance.
            \item Misaligned rewards can lead to unintended consequences.
        \end{itemize}

        The deployment of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-world applications raises significant ethical implications. Key areas of concern include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Algorithmic Bias
            \item Transparency
            \item Accountability
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Algorithmic Bias}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Algorithmic bias occurs when an RL model produces outcomes that are systematically prejudiced due to incorrect assumptions in the machine learning process.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Examples}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item **Healthcare:** An RL model trained on one demographic may perform poorly for others, e.g., predicting patient outcomes biased towards certain ethnic groups.
            \item **Hiring Algorithms:** An RL tool that favors candidates based on historically biased hiring data.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Mitigating algorithmic bias requires using diverse and representative datasets and continuous monitoring for fairness.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \begin{block}{Transparency}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item **Definition:** Clarity around how RL algorithms make decisions. Complex models often operate as "black boxes."
            \item **Example:** A customer service chatbot making unsatisfactory decisions should allow stakeholders to understand those decisions.
            \item **Key Point:** Transparency can be improved through interpretable AI frameworks and user-friendly documentation.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Accountability}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item **Definition:** Responsibility of stakeholders for the outcomes produced by RL systems.
            \item **Examples:**
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item In self-driving cars, clarification is needed on who is liable in the event of accidents.
                    \item In financial trading, establishing accountability for RL agents' trading decisions is crucial for compliance.
                \end{itemize}
            \item **Key Point:** Clear lines of accountability and governance are essential to uphold ethical standards.
