    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enhances learning efficiency by reducing training time.
        \item Leverages previously learned representations or policies effectively.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}

    \frametitle{Introduction to Ethical Implications}
    As reinforcement learning (RL) agents evolve through continual learning, their deployment raises critical ethical considerations. 
    Understanding these implications is essential for developing responsible and fair AI systems. We will focus on three key areas:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fairness
        \item Transparency
        \item Bias Mitigation
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Fairness}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Fairness in continual learning pertains to the unbiased treatment of different groups in decision-making processes.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Equitable Performance:} A continual learning agent should exhibit similar performance for all demographic groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity) to avoid discriminatory outcomes.
        \item \textbf{Dynamic Adaptivity:} As new data is introduced, the agent must adapt without compromising fairness across groups.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In hiring algorithms, a continually learning agent should ensure that its recommendations don't systematically disadvantage candidates from certain backgrounds even as it learns from new applicant data.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Transparency}

        Transparency involves making the operations and decision-making processes of AI systems understandable to users and stakeholders.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Explainability:} Users must understand how decisions are reached by the agent, which demands clear explanations of its learning processes and outcomes.
        \item \textbf{Model Interpretability:} The architecture of continual learning models should permit insights into how data influences decision-making. 
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        A bank’s continual learning model for credit scoring should allow customers to understand how their data impacts loan approval decisions, fostering trust and ensuring informed responses.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Bias Mitigation}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Bias mitigation refers to strategies used to identify, reduce, and correct biases in machine learning models.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Dynamic Bias Monitoring:} Continual learning agents should be equipped with protocols to regularly assess biases in their decisions, adapting as new data emerges.
        \item \textbf{Feedback Loops:} Implementing mechanisms for human oversight to correct biases as they become apparent in agent decisions can enhance accountability.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        An online platform employing a recommender system must continuously check its outputs to ensure it does not favor certain content types or creators unfairly, thereby promoting diverse content.
