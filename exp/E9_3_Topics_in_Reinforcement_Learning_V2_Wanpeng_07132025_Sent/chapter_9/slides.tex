    \frametitle{Introduction to Reward Structures}
    \begin{block}{Overview of Reward Structures in Reinforcement Learning}
        In reinforcement learning (RL), reward structures define how an agent receives feedback from its environment based on its actions. The goal of an RL agent is to maximize its cumulative reward over time. Understanding reward structures is crucial as they influence the agent's learning process and its overall behavior.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Significance of Reward Structures}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Guiding Behavior:} Reward structures direct the agent’s actions towards desirable outcomes. Strategically designing reward signals encourages specific behaviors that align with our objectives.
        \item \textbf{Learning Efficiency:} Well-structured rewards can lead to faster convergence on optimal policies, while poorly structured rewards may hinder learning or result in unintended behavior.
        \item \textbf{Robustness:} A robust reward structure helps ensure that the agent can generalize its learning across different states and situations, making it more adaptable in dynamic environments.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Rewards and Key Points}
    \begin{block}{Immediate vs. Delayed Rewards}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Immediate Rewards:} Given immediately after an action; useful for clear cause-and-effect tasks.
            \item \textbf{Delayed Rewards:} Given after a series of actions; more representative of complex tasks.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Types of Reward Structures}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Scalar Rewards:} Simplicity; a single value for each action.
            \item \textbf{Shaped Rewards:} Enhanced feedback to guide the agent (e.g., using potential-based shaping).
            \item \textbf{Sparse Rewards:} Rare feedback, typically used in environments with long-term consequences.
        \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Types of Reward Structures}
    \begin{block}{Introduction}
        In reinforcement learning (RL), reward structures play a crucial role in shaping the behavior of agents. Understanding different types of reward structures can help us design better agents capable of achieving desired outcomes.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Reward Structures - Scalar Rewards}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: Scalar rewards are single numerical values given to an agent for performing an action or achieving a goal.
        \item \textbf{Characteristics}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Typically ranges from a negative to a positive value, indicating a penalty or a reward.
            \item Simple and intuitive for the agent to interpret.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example}: In a game, the agent receives:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item +10 points for winning
            \item 0 points for a draw
            \item -5 points for losing
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: While easy to implement, scalar rewards might not provide sufficient guidance in complex environments.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Reward Structures - Shaped Rewards}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: Shaped rewards modify the scalar rewards to guide an agent's learning process more effectively.
        \item \textbf{Characteristics}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Intermediate rewards can be provided for reaching sub-goals or performing desirable behaviors.
            \item Encourages exploration and can lead to faster convergence to optimal policies.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example}: In a navigation task:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item +1 point for moving closer to a target 
            \item -1 point for moving away 
            \item Final goal reward also provided.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: Careful design of shaped rewards is essential, as poorly shaped rewards can lead to unintended behaviors (e.g., reward hacking).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Reward Structures - Sparse Rewards}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: Sparse rewards are infrequent and only provided upon achieving significant milestones or goals.
        \item \textbf{Characteristics}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Useful in complex environments where meaningful progress is rarely recognized.
            \item Challenges agents to explore a vast state space with limited guidance.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example}: In a maze:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The agent only receives a reward upon reaching the exit after potentially many steps without a reward.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: While sparse rewards can motivate exploratory behavior, they can also slow down learning due to a lack of feedback during the majority of the journey.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Summary of Reward Structures}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Scalar Rewards}: Simple, easy to interpret but may lack depth.
        \item \textbf{Shaped Rewards}: Provides guidance through incremental feedback but requires careful design.
        \item \textbf{Sparse Rewards}: Encourages exploration but can make learning challenging due to infrequent feedback.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Dense Reward}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Agents get frequent rewards at every time step.
            \item Example: +1 for moving closer to exit, -1 for hitting walls.
            \item \textbf{Impact}: Speeds up learning but can lead to suboptimal strategies.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Sparse Reward}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Rewards are infrequent, given only at task completion.
            \item Example: +10 for navigating the entire maze.
            \item \textbf{Impact}: Slows learning but encourages exploration.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Shaped Reward}

    \begin{block}{Essence of Reward Structures}
        Reward structures are critical for guiding agent behavior in reinforcement learning (RL). They inform the agent about the success or failure of its actions in the environment, leading to efficient learning and improved performance.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Performance Metrics}
        Various metrics help evaluate reward systems, including:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Cumulative Reward}: Total reward over a specified period.
            \item \textbf{Average Reward}: Average reward per time step, providing insights into long-term performance.
            \item \textbf{Convergence Speed}: Rate at which an agent learns an optimal policy.

    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Types of Reward Structures}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Sparse vs. Dense Rewards}: Sparse rewards provide feedback occasionally; dense rewards provide frequent feedback.
            \item \textbf{Shaping Rewards}: Intermediate rewards can accelerate learning by guiding towards the ultimate goal.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Exploration vs Exploitation}
        Reward structures must balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (relying on known rewarding actions) to improve performance and efficiency.
