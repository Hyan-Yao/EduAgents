## Grading Mechanism
- **Percentage-Based Grading**: Cumulative points calculated from each assessment.
- **Grade Range**: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).
- **Feedback**: Provided within a week of submissions for continuous improvement.

---

## Submission Logistics
- Materials submitted via Canvas Learning Management System (LMS).
- Late submissions incur a 10% penalty per day, up to five days; after which unapproved submissions will not be accepted.
- Professional preparation of documents required â€“ use LaTeX or Word for PDFs and ensure all code cells are executable for Notebooks.

## Real-World Relevance
Focus on solving real-world problems, including resource allocation in various industries (gaming, robotics, healthcare). Emphasis on ethical implications in reinforcement learning prepares students for responsible AI development roles.

---

## Continuous Feedback Mechanism
Students will provide feedback on course delivery to adapt teaching methods as necessary, with an option for anonymous submissions.
