\frametitle{Deep Q-Networks (DQN) - Example in Action}
    Consider an agent trained to play a video game:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The DQN processes frames (pixel data) and identifies obstacles & rewards.
        \item Agent's experiences modify Q-values, leading to better action choices over time.
    \end{itemize}
