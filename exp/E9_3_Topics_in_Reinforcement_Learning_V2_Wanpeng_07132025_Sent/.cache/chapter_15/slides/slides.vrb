\frametitle{Performance Evaluation Metrics - Cumulative Rewards}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Cumulative rewards represent the total reward accumulated by an agent over time while interacting with its environment.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
            G_t = \sum_{k=0}^{T} \gamma^k r_{t+k}
        \end{equation}
        where $G_t$ is the cumulative reward at time $t$, $r$ is the reward received, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\gamma$ (0 â‰¤ $\gamma$ < 1) is the discount factor.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        An agent playing a game receives rewards based on actions: +10 for winning a round, -5 for losing. If it wins 3 rounds and loses 1:
        \begin{equation}
            G = 10 + 10 + 10 - 5 = 25
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}
