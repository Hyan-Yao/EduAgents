        Performance metrics are pivotal in reinforcement learning, serving as a foundation for evaluating and improving models. Understanding these metrics enhances your ability to critically assess RL agents and their learning processes.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Cumulative Rewards - Definition}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Cumulative rewards, also known as total returns, are the sum of all rewards an agent receives over time during its interactions with the environment in a reinforcement learning (RL) setting.
    \end{block}
    \begin{equation}
        G_t = r_t + r_{t+1} + r_{t+2} + \ldots + r_T
    \end{equation}
    where \( T \) represents the final time step considered.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Cumulative Rewards - Significance}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Performance Indicator:} Cumulative rewards serve as a primary metric for evaluating the performance of an RL agent. The goal is to maximize this reward.
        
        \item \textbf{Comparison Across Strategies:} They provide a quantifiable measure of different RL policies and their success over time.
        
        \item \textbf{Policy Evaluation:} Analyzing cumulative rewards allows for assessment of the value of policies across multiple episodes.
        
        \item \textbf{Discounting Future Rewards:} To reflect present value, cumulative rewards may incorporate a discount factor \( \gamma \) (0 < \( \gamma \) < 1):
        \begin{equation}
            G_t^{\gamma} = r_t + \gamma r_{t+1} + \gamma^2 r_{t+2} + \ldots
        \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Cumulative Rewards - Example Scenario}
    Consider an agent navigating through a maze:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rewards: +10 for reaching the goal, -1 for hitting a wall.
        \item Reward sequence: \( r_0 = 0, r_1 = 0, r_2 = 10 \).
    \end{itemize}
    The cumulative reward can be calculated as:
    \begin{equation}
        G_0 = 0 + 0 + 10 = 10
    \end{equation}
    This total indicates the agent's success in maximizing its goal.

                \item \textbf{Fast Convergence:} Efficient exploration identifies the goal quickly.
                \item \textbf{Slow Convergence:} Stuck in local optima or exploring suboptimal paths extends learning time.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Implications for Model Performance}

    \frametitle{Overfitting in RL Models - Understanding Overfitting}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Overfitting occurs when a model learns not just the underlying patterns in the training data but also the noise and outliers.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Implications}
        This results in a model that performs well on training data but poorly on unseen test data.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Illustration:} A curve that perfectly fits all the training points may wobble excessively, leading to poor performance on new data points.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Overfitting in RL Models - Causes and Effects}
    \begin{block}{Overfitting in Reinforcement Learning}
        In RL, overfitting can occur when:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The policy (\(\pi\)) or value function (\(Q\)) becomes too specialized to the training environment.
            \item Limited exploration leads to lack of robust strategies.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Causes of Overfitting}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Complex models may lead to memorization rather than generalization.
            \item Insufficient training data results in models that do not perform well under diverse conditions.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Overfitting in RL Models - Impact and Mitigation Strategies}
    \begin{block}{Impacts of Overfitting}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reduced generalization can lead to a model that excels in training simulations but fails in real-world scenarios.
            \item Increased maintenance costs as overfit models require continuous adjustments as environments change.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Strategies to Mitigate Overfitting}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Regularization Techniques:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Dropout and weight regularization (L1 or L2).
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Ensemble Methods:} Averages predictions from multiple models to improve generalization.
            \item \textbf{Cross-Validation:} Splits training data into subsets for broader learning.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Understanding and mitigating overfitting is critical to developing effective RL models that adapt well to diverse real-world situations.

    \frametitle{Validation Metrics - Introduction}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Validation metrics are essential for evaluating the performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) models. They help identify how effectively a model is learning and adapting to its environment compared to more straightforward metrics used in supervised learning.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Validation Metrics - Key Metrics Part 1}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Cumulative Reward (Return), \(G_t\)}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} Total reward from time step \(t\) onward.
            \item \textbf{Formula:}
            \begin{equation}
                G_t = R_t + \gamma R_{t+1} + \gamma^2 R_{t+2} + \ldots
            \end{equation}
            where \(R\) is the reward and \(\gamma\) (0 < \(\gamma\) < 1) is the discount factor.
            \item \textbf{Example:} If rewards are [1, 2, 3] with \(\gamma = 0.9\), then:
            \begin{equation}
                G_t = 3 + 0.9 \times 2 + 0.9^2 \times 1 \approx 4.71.
            \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Average Reward}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} Mean of cumulative rewards over episodes.
            \item \textbf{Formula:}
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Average Reward} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{t,i}
            \end{equation}
            where \(N\) is the number of episodes.
            \item \textbf{Example:} Cumulative rewards [10, 20, 15, 25, 30] yield:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Average Reward} = \frac{10 + 20 + 15 + 25 + 30}{5} = 20.
            \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} Proportion of episodes where the agent achieves its goal.
            \item \textbf{Formula:}
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Success Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Successes}}{\text{Total Episodes}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example:} For 8 successes in 10 episodes:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Success Rate} = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \text{ or } 80\%.
            \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Training Efficiency}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Measure of how quickly an agent learns an effective policy relative to interactions or episodes.
            \item Evaluated by the number of episodes to reach a predefined average reward threshold.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Validation Metrics - Importance and Conclusion}
    \begin{block}{Importance of Validation Metrics}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Performance Insight:} Indicates agent's performance to guide improvements.
            \item \textbf{Model Selection:} Aids in comparing models or algorithms for effectiveness in specific environments.
            \item \textbf{Debugging:} Helps identify issues from deviations in expected metric values.
