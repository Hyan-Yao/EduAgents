    \textbf{Sample Reward Function:}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def reward_function(state, action, next_state):
    if goal_achieved(next_state):
        return 100  # Positive reward for achieving goal
    elif action_leads_to_danger(state):
        return -50  # Negative reward for dangerous actions
    else:
        return -1  # Small penalty for regular actions
    \end{lstlisting}

    \textbf{Key Points:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Design of reward structures is pivotal for success in RL.
        \item Understanding performance metrics enhances evaluation of agent behavior.
        \item Future research is vital for enhancing RL systems' capabilities.
    \end{itemize}
