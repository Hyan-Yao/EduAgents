Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan: Reinforcement Learning in Real-World Applications

## Project Overview
The capstone project aims to allow students to apply reinforcement learning (RL) concepts and algorithms to solve complex real-world problems, serving as a substitute for the final examination of the course "E9_3: Topics in Reinforcement Learning."

## Learning Objectives
- Articulate key concepts and algorithms in reinforcement learning.
- Demonstrate proficiency in implementing RL algorithms using Python and TF/PyTorch.
- Apply RL techniques to address real-world scenarios and critically analyze effectiveness.
- Evaluate models using various performance metrics and interpret results.
- Discuss ethical implications, including biases and algorithmic transparency.
- Understand continual learning techniques in dynamic environments.
