### Learning Objectives for E9_3: Topics in Reinforcement Learning

1. **Foundational Understanding**  
   Students will be able to articulate the key concepts and algorithms in reinforcement learning, including value-based, policy-based, and model-based approaches.

2. **Algorithm Implementation**  
   Students will demonstrate proficiency in implementing key reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks, Policy Gradients) using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

3. **Problem Solving**  
   Students will apply reinforcement learning techniques to solve real-world problems, critically analyzing the efficacy of different approaches for given scenarios.

4. **Performance Evaluation**  
   Students will learn to evaluate and validate reinforcement learning models through various performance metrics (e.g., cumulative reward, convergence rates, overfitting) and interpret the results.

5. **Ethical Considerations**  
   Students will discuss the ethical implications and societal impact of reinforcement learning applications, such as biases in data and algorithmic transparency.

6. **Continual Learning**  
   Students will recognize the importance of continual learning in reinforcement learning systems and will implement strategies to adapt their agents in dynamic environments.
