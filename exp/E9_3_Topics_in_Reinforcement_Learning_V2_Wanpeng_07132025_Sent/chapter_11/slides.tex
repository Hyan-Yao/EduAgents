    \frametitle{Formula Representation}
    \begin{block}{Value Function}
        One key formula in RL is the Value Function:
        \begin{equation}
            V(s) = \max_a \left( R(s, a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s' | s, a) V(s') \right)

        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( V(s) \) = Value of state \( s \)
            \item \( R(s, a) \) = Immediate reward for action \( a \) in state \( s \)
            \item \( \gamma \) = Discount factor for future rewards
            \item \( P(s' | s, a) \) = Probability of transitioning to state \( s' \) from \( s \) after \( a \)

    \frametitle{Understanding Bias in Data - Part 1}
    \begin{block}{Understanding Data Bias}
        \textbf{Definition of Bias in Data}:\\
        Bias in data refers to a systematic error that leads to an unfair representation of certain groups or patterns. In the context of reinforcement learning (RL), biased datasets can cause algorithms to make skewed decisions.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{How Bias Affects RL Decision-Making}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Training Phase}:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item RL algorithms learn from experiences recorded in the training data. If biased, the learned policy perpetuates those biases.
                  \item Example: An RL agent trained on data from one demographic may favor that demographic.
              \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Real-World Implications}:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item Hiring Algorithms: Historical data reflecting past biases may disadvantage underrepresented candidates. 
                  \item Criminal Justice: Predictive policing may over-police communities based on biased crime data.
