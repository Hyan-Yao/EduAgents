        Q-learning is a value-based off-policy RL algorithm that learns Q-values, representing the expected utility of actions from given states.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Key Concept}
        The Q-value update is based on the Bellman equation:
        \begin{equation}
            Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
        \end{equation}
        Where:

    \frametitle{Performance Evaluation Metrics - Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Evaluating the performance of an agent in Reinforcement Learning (RL) is crucial.
        \item Several metrics provide insights into agent learning:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Cumulative Rewards
            \item Convergence Rates
            \item Overfitting
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Performance Evaluation Metrics - Cumulative Rewards}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Cumulative rewards represent the total reward accumulated by an agent over time while interacting with its environment. 
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
            G_t = \sum_{k=0}^{T} \gamma^k r_{t+k}
        \end{equation}
        where $G_t$ is the cumulative reward at time $t$, $r$ is the reward received, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\gamma$ (0 ≤ $\gamma$ < 1) is the discount factor.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        An agent playing a game receives rewards based on actions: +10 for winning a round, -5 for losing. If it wins 3 rounds and loses 1:
        \begin{equation}
            G = 10 + 10 + 10 - 5 = 25
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Performance Evaluation Metrics - Convergence Rates and Overfitting}
    
    \textbf{Convergence Rates}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        The convergence rate measures how quickly an RL agent approaches the optimal policy or value function.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Faster convergence indicates a more efficient learning algorithm.
        \item Analyze convergence to determine further tuning needs.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Overfitting}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Overfitting occurs when an agent excels on training data but fails on unseen situations.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Symptoms include high training performance but poor testing performance.
        \item Prevention techniques: regularization, dropout, diverse environment training.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        An agent trained in a specific maze performs well there but poorly in a slightly altered version, indicating overfitting.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Performance Evaluation Metrics - Summary and Key Takeaways}
    \textbf{Summary}

    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations in RL - Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item RL applications are growing in fields like healthcare, finance, and transportation.
        \item Key ethical implications include:
        \begin{itemize}

        \end{itemize}
        \item Understanding these issues is crucial for trust and integrity in RL systems.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations in RL - Biases in Data}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Bias in data occurs when the collected data reflects systemic prejudices, leading to unfair outcomes.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Impact in RL:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Trained on biased data, RL agents may develop strategies reinforcing those biases.
            \item Example: In hiring, if historical data has a bias, an RL model may favor certain demographics unfairly.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations in RL - Algorithmic Transparency}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Algorithmic transparency refers to how easily the workings of an algorithm can be understood by humans.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Importance:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item High transparency promotes trust and accountability.
            \item Lack of transparency can lead to misuse and unintended consequences.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Example: Autonomous vehicles with opaque decision-making processes can endanger lives.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points and Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ethical Design: Assess biases during data collection and ensure fairness in decision-making.
        \item Stakeholder Engagement: Involve diverse stakeholders to understand biases and societal impacts.
        \item Regulatory Compliance: Stay informed about data ethics laws, such as GDPR.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Addressing ethical dimensions proactively enhances the social acceptability and reduces harm in RL applications.
    \end{block}

    \frametitle{Continual Learning and Adaptation - Overview}
    In the context of Reinforcement Learning (RL), continual learning refers to the ability of an agent to learn and adapt over time in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional RL, which assumes a static environment and fixed tasks, continual learning enables agents to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Capitalize on previous learning experiences
        \item Adjust strategies in response to changes in the environment
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Importance of Continual Learning in RL}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Dynamic Environments}: 
        Real-world scenarios often present situations that change over time, which may include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Evolving user preferences (e.g., recommendation systems)
            \item Fluctuating market conditions (e.g., trading algorithms)
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Efficiency in Learning}:
