    \begin{block}{Data Blocks and Replication}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Data Blocks:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item HDFS divides each file into blocks (typically 128 MB).
                    \item Each block is stored in a DataNode, allowing parallel processing and fault tolerance.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Replication:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Each data block is replicated across multiple DataNodes (default is 3 replicas).
                    \item \textbf{Strategy:} Blocks stored across different racks to prevent loss in case of rack failure.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Example:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    If a 1 GB file is stored with a block size of 256 MB, it is divided into four blocks with three copies each, distributed across various DataNodes.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
