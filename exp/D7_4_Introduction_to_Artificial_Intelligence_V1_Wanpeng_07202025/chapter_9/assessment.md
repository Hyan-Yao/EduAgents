### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** Which of the following is a key takeaway regarding Bayesian networks?

  A) They are only useful for linear models
  B) They can model complex dependencies
  C) They replace all other forms of AI
  D) All probabilities are discrete

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Bayesian networks excel in modeling complex dependencies among a set of variables.

**Question 2:** What is the role of Bayes’ Theorem in Bayesian networks?

  A) To calculate the average of a dataset
  B) To update probabilities based on new evidence
  C) To minimize the loss function in optimization
  D) To transform discrete data into continuous data

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Bayes’ Theorem allows for the updating of probabilities as new evidence is introduced.

**Question 3:** Which application area benefits from Bayesian networks?

  A) Image processing
  B) Natural language processing
  C) Healthcare diagnosis
  D) Game development

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Bayesian networks are particularly useful in healthcare for supporting diagnosis by evaluating symptoms against potential diseases.

**Question 4:** What aspect of Bayesian networks makes them popular in uncertain environments?

  A) They require no prior knowledge
  B) They are easy to implement in any programming language
  C) They enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability
  D) They eliminate all forms of uncertainty

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Bayesian networks are valued for their ability to handle uncertainty effectively while providing interpretable and accurate predictions.
