### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the primary lesson learned regarding MDPs and reinforcement learning?

  A) They are not applicable in real-world scenarios
  B) They are foundational to understanding AI decision making
  C) Deep learning is more important
  D) They require complex mathematical proofs

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** MDPs and reinforcement learning are fundamental for understanding sophisticated decision-making processes in AI.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is NOT a component of an MDP?

  A) States (S)
  B) Actions (A)
  C) Optimality (O)
  D) Reward Function (R)

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Optimality is not a formal component of an MDP; it refers to the goal of maximizing cumulative reward.

**Question 3:** What role does the exploration vs. exploitation trade-off play in reinforcement learning?

  A) It is a method to optimize performance with no consequences.
  B) It involves choosing between taking risks to discover new strategies versus leveraging known strategies for immediate rewards.
  C) It is unrelated to the learning process.
  D) It is solely about exploring new actions.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Exploration involves trying new strategies, while exploitation focuses on making the best use of known strategies to maximize rewards.
