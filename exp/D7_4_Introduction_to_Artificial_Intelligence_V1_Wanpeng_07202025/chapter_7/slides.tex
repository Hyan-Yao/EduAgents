    \begin{block}{Introduction}
        In the world of machine learning, evaluating model performance is crucial. Metrics help quantify the effectiveness of our models in making predictions.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Metrics Explained - Part 1}
    % Accuracy and Precision
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Accuracy}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances in the dataset.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
            \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If out of 100 predictions, 90 are correct (70 true positives + 20 true negatives):
            \begin{equation}
            \text{Accuracy} = \frac{90}{100} = 0.90 \text{ or } 90\%
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Key Point}: Good for balanced datasets; may mislead in imbalanced classes.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Precision}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
            \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If a model predicts 30 positives, but 20 are correct:
            \begin{equation}
            \text{Precision} = \frac{20}{30} = 0.67 \text{ or } 67\%
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Key Point}: Important when false positives are costly (e.g., fraud detection).
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Recall (Sensitivity)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
            \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If there are 50 actual positives and the model correctly identifies 40:
            \begin{equation}
            \text{Recall} = \frac{40}{50} = 0.80 \text{ or } 80\%
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Key Point}: Crucial when missing a positive instance is critical (e.g., disease diagnosis).
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{F1 Score}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
            \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If Precision is 0.67 and Recall is 0.80:
            \begin{equation}
            \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{0.67 \times 0.80}{0.67 + 0.80} \approx 0.73
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Key Point}: Useful for balancing precision and recall, important for imbalanced datasets.

        \item \textbf{Explanation}: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, leading to poor generalization.
        \item \textbf{Example}: For instance, training a model to recognize cats might lead it to memorize specific features instead of general cat traits, impacting its ability to classify unseen images.
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: Maintain a balance between bias and variance. Techniques to combat overfitting include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Cross-validation

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Missing data: Incomplete datasets can skew results, necessitating imputation or removal of affected points.
            \item Noisy data: Outliers and irrelevant features can confuse models.
            \item Imbalanced datasets: Underrepresented classes can lead to bias towards the majority class.

        \item \textbf{Example}: A model predicting loan approvals that lacks interpretability may lead to mistrust, as stakeholders cannot justify decisions made.
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: Techniques to improve interpretability include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
            \item LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
