# Final Project Plan: AI for Social Good: Solving Real-World Challenges

## Project Description
The final project requires students to leverage AI methodologies to address a real-world social issue. Students will propose and implement an AI-based solution, focusing on ethical implications and societal impact. This project promotes critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and collaboration (if executed in teams).

## Objectives
1. Describe core concepts, theories, and methodologies in AI.
2. Implement search algorithms and planning mechanisms.
3. Apply reinforcement learning techniques where appropriate.
4. Analyze and validate the performance of AI solutions.
5. Discuss ethical considerations related to AI applications.
