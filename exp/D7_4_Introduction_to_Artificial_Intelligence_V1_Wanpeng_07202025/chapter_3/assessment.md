- Identify key characteristics and applications of multi-agent systems.
- Engage in a question-and-answer session to clarify doubts and deepen understanding.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is a key characteristic of multi-agent systems?

  A) Autonomy
  B) Dependence
  C) Isolation
  D) Simplicity

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Autonomy is a fundamental characteristic of multi-agent systems, allowing agents to operate independently.

**Question 2:** In game theory, what do we call the decisions available to players?

  A) Players
  B) Strategies
  C) Payoffs
  D) Outcomes

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Strategies are the decisions available to players that will influence the outcomes of the game.

**Question 3:** What is a core benefit of using Alpha-Beta Pruning in search algorithms?

  A) Increases time complexity
  B) Provides a guaranteed win
  C) Reduces the number of nodes evaluated
  D) Simplifies the game rules

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Alpha-Beta Pruning optimizes the minimax algorithm by reducing the number of nodes that need to be evaluated, making it more efficient.

**Question 4:** Which of the following is a practical application of multi-agent systems?

  A) Personal budgeting
  B) Social media management
  C) Traffic management
  D) Online shopping

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Traffic management is a common application of multi-agent systems where agents manage various traffic elements to optimize flow.

### Activities
- Create a diagram that illustrates the interactions between agents in a multi-agent system, highlighting cooperation and competition.
- Design a simple game using the minimax algorithm, and explain how to apply Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize your solution.

### Discussion Questions
- What are some examples of multi-agent systems you encounter in your daily life?
- How does the concept of cooperation differ from competition in multi-agent systems?
- What challenges do you foresee in implementing algorithms like minimax and alpha-beta pruning in real-world scenarios?
