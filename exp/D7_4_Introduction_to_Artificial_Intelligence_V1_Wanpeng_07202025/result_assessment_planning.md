## Submission Logistics
- All submissions will be made via Canvas LMS.
- Homework must be submitted in both PDF and .ipynb format.
- Project reports are to be submitted in PDF format, with code execution supplied through .ipynb files.

## Feedback and Iteration
- Regular feedback will occur during office hours and peer-review sessions.
- Opportunities for project iterations based on instructor and peer feedback will be provided throughout the semester.

## Key Considerations
- Continuous formative assessments support cumulative knowledge building.
- Emphasis on collaboration, peer feedback, and real-world applications enhances learning.
- The cumulative final project reinforces the application of AI concepts in practical scenarios, preparing students for careers in the AI field.
