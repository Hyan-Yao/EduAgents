    \begin{block}{Policy}
        A policy defines a strategy that dictates the behavior of an agent at each state.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Deterministic:} A specific action from each state (π(s) = a).
        \item \textbf{Stochastic:} A probability distribution over actions is defined (π(a|s) = P(a|s)).
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Suboptimal Policies: Not all policies guarantee the best outcome; evaluation and optimization are crucial.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        \textbf{Scenario:} Navigation task at a crossroad (s).\\
        The action (a) may be to go left or right based on goal or defined probabilities.
