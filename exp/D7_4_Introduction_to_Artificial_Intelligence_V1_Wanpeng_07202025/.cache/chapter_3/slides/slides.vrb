\frametitle{Strategies for Multi-Agent Search - Advantages & Limitations}
    \begin{block}{Advantages}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Increased coverage and exploration speed.
            \item Parallelism can lead to faster problem-solving.
            \item Diverse strategies allow flexibility and adaptability in dynamic environments.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Limitations}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Potential for conflict and resource wastage in competitive settings.
            \item Coordination overhead in cooperative tasks may slow progress.
            \item Complexity of strategy implementation can increase with the number of agents.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        The choice of strategy in multi-agent search scenarios depends on the goals of the agents, the environment, and the tasks. Understanding these strategies enhances the design of effective multi-agent systems.
