                \item **Environment**: The setting in which the agent operates (e.g., a game or simulation).
                \item **Actions**: Choices available to the agent (e.g., moving left or right).
                \item **State**: Current situation of the agent in the environment.
                \item **Reward**: Feedback signal after an action (positive for good actions, negative for bad ones).

    \frametitle{Reinforcement Learning - How It Works}

    \begin{block}{Process of RL}
        The RL process can be described as follows:
    \end{block}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item **Initialization**: Agent starts with no knowledge of the environment.
        \item **Interaction**: Agent observes the current state of the environment.
        \item **Action Selection**: Agent chooses an action based on a policy.
        \item **State Transition**: Environment responds, transitioning to a new state.
        \item **Reward Signal**: Agent receives a reward based on the action taken.
        \item **Learning**: Agent updates its policy based on the reward.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In chess, the agent (chess program) evaluates its moves based on the board state, 
        receiving rewards for winning and penalties for losing, which improve its strategy over time.

  \frametitle{Common Machine Learning Challenges}
  In this presentation, we will discuss key challenges in machine learning, including:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Overfitting
    \item Underfitting
    \item Bias-Variance Tradeoff
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{1. Overfitting}

  \begin{block}{Definition}
    Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise along with the underlying patterns. This leads to high accuracy on the training set but poor generalization on unseen data.
  \end{block}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Complexity:} The model is overly complex, often with too many parameters.
    \item \textbf{Performance:} Excellent training accuracy but significantly lower test accuracy.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Example}
    A 9th-degree polynomial regression model fits every point in a small dataset perfectly, but performs poorly on new data.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Prevention Strategies}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Simplifying the model (e.g., using fewer features)
      \item Employing regularization techniques (e.g., Lasso, Ridge)
      \item Pruning decision trees
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{2. Underfitting}

  \begin{block}{Definition}
    Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test sets.
  \end{block}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Simplicity:} The model is not complex enough to represent the data accurately.
    \item \textbf{Performance:} Low accuracy on both training and test datasets.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Example}
    Using a linear model to fit a complex non-linear dataset, such as predicting house prices with only the square footage.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Prevention Strategies}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Increasing model complexity (e.g., using more features)
      \item Improving feature selection and engineering
      \item Adding interaction or polynomial terms
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{3. Bias-Variance Tradeoff}

  \begin{block}{Definition}
    The bias-variance tradeoff balances two sources of error affecting model performance:
  \end{block}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bias:} Error from overly simplistic assumptions, leading to underfitting.
    \item \textbf{Variance:} Error from excessive sensitivity to training set fluctuations, leading to overfitting.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Visualization}
    A graph illustrating how training error and validation error change with model complexity.
  \end{block}

  \begin{equation}
    \text{MSE} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \sigma^2
  \end{equation}

  \begin{block}{Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Right model complexity is crucial.
      \item Regularization techniques manage the tradeoff.
      \item Cross-validation aids in understanding bias and variance.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Conclusion}

  Understanding and addressing challenges such as overfitting, underfitting, and the bias-variance tradeoff are critical for effectively applying machine learning algorithms. Striking the right balance ensures that models perform well on training data and generalize effectively to new, unseen data.
