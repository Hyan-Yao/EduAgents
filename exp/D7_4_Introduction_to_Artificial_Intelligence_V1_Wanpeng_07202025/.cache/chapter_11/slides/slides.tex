    \frametitle{Introduction to Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. It is inspired by behavioral psychology and differs from traditional learning paradigms.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Agent:} The learner or decision maker (e.g., a robot, game character).
        \item \textbf{Environment:} Everything the agent interacts with to make decisions (e.g., a game board, physical world).
        \item \textbf{Actions:} The set of all possible moves the agent can take.
        \item \textbf{State:} The current situation of the agent in the environment.
        \item \textbf{Reward:} A feedback signal that evaluates the action taken by the agent.

    \frametitle{Mathematical Framework}
    \begin{block}{Cumulative Reward (Return)}
        \begin{equation}
            R_t = r_t + \gamma r_{t+1} + \gamma^2 r_{t+2} + \ldots
        \end{equation}
        Here, \( R_t \) is the cumulative reward starting from time \( t \), \( r_t \) is the immediate reward at time \( t \), and \( \gamma \) (0 â‰¤ \( \gamma \) < 1) is the discount factor.

    \frametitle{Introduction to RL}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Unlike supervised learning, RL focuses on learning from the consequences of actions taken in the environment.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Key Components of Reinforcement Learning}
    \frametitle{Key Components}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Agent}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The learner or decision-maker that interacts with the environment.
                \item \textit{Example:} A robot navigating a maze.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Environment}

            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Key Components Continued}
    \frametitle{Key Components}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Action (a)}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The choices available to the agent.
                \item \textit{Example:} Moving up, down, left, or right in the maze.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Reward (r)}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item A feedback signal received after taking an action.
                \item \textit{Example:} +10 for reaching the exit, -1 for hitting a wall.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The Interaction Loop}
    \frametitle{The Interaction Loop}
    The learning process in RL can be summarized in a feedback loop:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Agent observes the current state (s) of the environment.
        \item Agent selects an action (a) based on its policy.
        \item Action is executed, leading to a new state (s').
        \item Agent receives a reward (r) based on the action taken.
        \item Agent updates its policy using the reward and new state.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Formula Overview}
    \frametitle{Formula Overview}
    The reinforcement learning process can be represented by the following equation emphasizing the value of an action:
    \begin{equation}
        V(s) = \max_a \left( R(s, a) + \gamma V(s') \right)
    \end{equation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{V(s):} Value of being in state \(s\).
        \item \textbf{R(s, a):} Immediate reward after action \(a\) in state \(s\).
        \item \textbf{\(\gamma\):} Discount factor (0 â‰¤ \(\gamma\) < 1).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \frametitle{Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item RL is distinct from supervised learning: RL relies on feedback rather than labeled examples.
        \item Exploring vs. Exploiting: Crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Conclusion}
    \frametitle{Conclusion}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Note for Students}
    \frametitle{Note for Students}
    Make sure to visualize these concepts and think of real-life analogies (like learning to ride a bike) to better grasp the working mechanism of reinforcement learning!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Exploration vs. Exploitation}
    \begin{block}{Understanding the Trade-Off}
        In reinforcement learning, agents learn to make decisions by interacting with their environment, balancing two critical strategies: exploration and exploitation.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration}: Trying new actions to discover their effects, taking risks for better long-term rewards.
        \item \textbf{Exploitation}: Leveraging known information to maximize immediate rewards, taking the best-known route.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The Trade-Off}
    \begin{block}{Key Challenges}
        The challenge lies in balance: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Too much exploration can lead to suboptimal immediate reward outcomes.
            \item Excessive exploitation can hinder discovering potentially better options.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Balancing Act: Vital for effective learning and decision-making.
            \item Long-term vs. Short-term Rewards: Exploration may yield lower short-term payoffs but can lead to greater long-term rewards.
            \item Strategies: 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Epsilon-Greedy Strategy
                    \item Softmax Action Selection
                \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Example and Visual Representation}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Imagine a robot learning to find the most efficient cleaning path:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If it always exploits (same path), it may miss shortcuts.
            \item If it always explores (changing paths), it may take longer to find the best route.
        \end{itemize}
        A balance leads to optimized cleaning efficiency.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Visual Representation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Graph: Trade-off between exploration and exploitation
            \item X-axis: Time
            \item Y-axis: Total Reward
            \item Compare cumulative rewards of exploratory vs. exploitative strategies.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Conclusion and Formula Highlight}
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Striking the right balance between exploration and exploitation is critical. Effective strategies ensure agents achieve optimal performance while adapting to their environments.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy}
        For the Epsilon-Greedy Strategy:
        \begin{equation}
        \text{Action Selection} = 
        \begin{cases} 
        \text{Explore} & \text{with probability } \epsilon \\ 
        \text{Exploit} & \text{with probability } 1 - \epsilon 
        \end{cases}
        \end{equation}

    \frametitle{Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)}
    \begin{block}{Introduction to MDPs}
        Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in environments where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker. They serve as a foundational model for reinforcement learning problems.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Components of MDPs}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{States (S)}: Set of all possible states where the agent can be. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example: In a chess game, each unique arrangement of pieces is a different state.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Actions (A)}: Set of all possible actions the agent can take from each state. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example: Possible moves in chess like â€˜move pawnâ€™, â€˜capture pieceâ€™, etc.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Transition Function (P)}: Defines the probability of moving from one state to another given a particular action.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \( P(s'|s,a) \) is the probability of reaching state \( s' \) from state \( s \) after taking action \( a \).
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Rewards (R)}: Numerical feedback received after transitioning from one state to another due to an action.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example: In chess, gaining a piece might yield a positive reward, while losing a piece results in a negative reward.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Discount Factor (\(\gamma\))}: A value between 0 and 1 that models the importance of future rewards. A higher value gives more significance to future rewards.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example: If \( \gamma = 0.9 \), immediate rewards are considered more important than those received in the distant future.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Relevance in Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MDPs formalize the environment in which reinforcement learning agents operate:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Provide a systematic way to handle uncertainty and reduce the complexity of predicting actions and rewards.
            \item Algorithms like Q-learning and policy gradients build upon the principles of MDPs for learning optimal policies.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example of an MDP}
    Imagine a simple grid world where an agent can move in four directions (up, down, left, right):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{States}: Each position on the grid.
        \item \textbf{Actions}: Move up, move down, move left, move right.
        \item \textbf{Transitions}: Moving up from the bottom edge results in staying in the same position (probability=1).
        \item \textbf{Rewards}: Reaching a specific goal cell earns +10 points, while hitting a wall earns -1 point.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Remember}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MDPs encapsulate the interaction of states, actions, and rewards.
        \item The formal structure helps agents to learn optimal strategies over time.
        \item Understanding MDPs is crucial for implementing various reinforcement learning algorithms.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Next Steps}
    Now that you have a grasp of MDPs, we will explore practical implementations using Q-learningâ€”a fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Q-Learning}
    \begin{block}{Introduction to Q-Learning}
        Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used for learning the value of an action in a particular state. It helps in determining the best action to take in a given state.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Agent:} The learner or decision maker.
        \item \textbf{Environment:} Everything the agent interacts with.
        \item \textbf{State (\textit{s}):} A specific situation in the environment.
        \item \textbf{Action (\textit{a}):} A choice made by the agent that affects the environment.
        \item \textbf{Reward (\textit{r}):} Feedback received after taking an action in a state.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mathematical Foundation}
    \begin{block}{Q-Value}
        Q(s, a) represents the expected future rewards for taking action \textit{a} in state \textit{s} and following the optimal policy thereafter.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{equation}
    Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)\right]
    \end{equation}
    
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\alpha$ = Learning rate (0 < $\alpha$ â‰¤ 1)
        \item $\gamma$ = Discount factor (0 â‰¤ $\gamma$ < 1)
        \item $s'$ = Next state after taking action \textit{a}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Implementation Steps}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Initialize Q-Table:} Create a table with all states and actions initialized to zero.
        \item \textbf{Choose Action:} Use an exploration strategy (e.g., $\epsilon$-greedy).
        \item \textbf{Observe Reward and Next State:} Execute the chosen action and observe the reward and resultant state.
        \item \textbf{Update Q-Value:} Use the Bellman equation to update the Q-value.
        \item \textbf{Repeat:} Continue this process until convergence or for a predefined number of episodes.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    Q-Learning empowers agents to learn optimal actions through experience. Mastery of this algorithm forms the backbone for understanding more advanced reinforcement learning techniques like Policy Gradient Methods, which we will explore next.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Policy Gradient Methods - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Policy Gradient methods are a family of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that focus on directly optimizing the policy function. Unlike value-based methods (e.g., Q-Learning) that derive a policy indirectly through value functions, policy gradient methods parameterize the policy and update it based on the performance of actions taken in the environment.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Key Differences from Value-Based Methods}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Optimization Objective}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Policy Gradient: Directly optimizes the policy by increasing the probability of successful actions.
                \item Value-Based: Estimates the value of actions (Q-values) to derive the optimal policy indirectly.
            \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Approach}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Policy Gradient: Learns a parameterized policy $ \pi_\theta(a|s) $, where $ \theta $ represents the parameters of the policy.
                \item Value-Based: Utilizes techniques like Temporal Difference learning, creating a Q-table or a function approximator to guide action selection.
            \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Policy Gradient: Naturally supports exploration with a stochastic policy.
                \item Value-Based: Typically uses strategies like $\epsilon$-greedy for exploration, limiting policy diversity.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Policy Optimization and Key Formula}
    The core idea in policy gradient methods is to maximize the expected reward $ J(\theta) $ defined as:
    \begin{equation}
