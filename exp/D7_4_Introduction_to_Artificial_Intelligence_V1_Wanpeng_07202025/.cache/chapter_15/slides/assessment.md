## Section 16: Q&A Session

### Learning Objectives
- Encourage active participation and clarify doubts during the Q&A session.
- Promote discussions on key concepts of deep learning.
- Foster a collaborative learning environment where students can share knowledge.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the primary purpose of the 'forward pass' in a neural network?

  A) To implement backpropagation
  B) To update the network's weights
  C) To calculate the loss function
  D) To pass inputs through the network to generate an output

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** The 'forward pass' is the process of feeding input data through the network layers to produce an output, which is essential for prediction.

**Question 2:** Which architecture is primarily used for image processing tasks?

  A) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  B) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  C) Feedforward Neural Networks
  D) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specifically designed to process data with a grid-like topology, making them ideal for image data.

**Question 3:** What is the main function of the activation function in a neural network?

  A) To standardize input data
  B) To determine the output of a neuron
  C) To compute the loss function
  D) To initialize network weights

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The activation function introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing the network to learn complex patterns by determining the output of a neuron based on its input.

**Question 4:** In deep learning, which method helps prevent overfitting?

  A) Reducing training data size
  B) Increasing the number of neurons
  C) Early stopping during training
  D) Using a fixed learning rate

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Early stopping is a regularization technique that halts training when performance on a validation set starts to degrade, which helps to prevent overfitting.
