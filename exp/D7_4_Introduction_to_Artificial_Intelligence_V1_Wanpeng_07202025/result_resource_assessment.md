## Faculty Expertise Requirements

1. **Subject Expertise**:  
   - Strong background in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and ethics in AI.
   - Deep understanding of reinforcement learning and Markov Decision Processes, particularly in the context of deep reinforcement learning.
   - Research or practical application experience preferred to enrich classroom discussions.

2. **Pedagogical Skills**:  
   - Ability to convey complex concepts clearly, utilizing interactive teaching techniques to promote student engagement.
   - Experience in experiential learning methods, incorporating case studies, group projects on algorithm development, and peer teaching opportunities.
   - Commitment to continuous professional development in the rapidly evolving AI field, including participation in workshops, online courses, or conferences.

## Necessary Computing Resources

1. **Hardware Specifications**:  
   - Access to sufficient computing resources, including servers with GPU capabilities for heavy AI model training.
   - Class computers or student laptops must meet specifications for running AI software effectively.
   - Consideration for lab environments utilizing cloud resources (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for remote access and complex computations.

2. **Software Requirements**:  
   - Essential tools include Python and libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
   - Utilization of integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Jupyter Notebooks for an interactive learning experience.
   - Any required proprietary software should be properly licensed, with clear access instructions provided to students.

## Scheduling Constraints

1. **Class Format**:  
   - Classes are scheduled for 75-minute sessions delivered in person, requiring effective classroom setup and IT support.
   - Consider block scheduling or staggered formats for lab-intensive weeks, possibly incorporating double sessions for hands-on content.
   - Exploring evening or weekend sessions to accommodate diverse student schedules.

2. **TA Support and Integration**:  
   - Clear definition of TA responsibilities to actively support classroom activities and provide reassurance during labs.
   - Develop feedback mechanisms to assess TA effectiveness and incorporate student input for continuous improvement.

## Facility Limitations

1. **Classroom Technology**:  
   - Classrooms must be equipped with high-speed internet, secure Wi-Fi access, and appropriate technological tools, including computers for students, projectors, and collaboration technology.
   - Extra considerations for smart boards or devices enabling group work during classes to enhance interactive learning.

2. **Physical Space Constraints**:  
   - Assess classroom size to ensure it accommodates all enrolled students comfortably, especially during interactive segments.
   - Explore strategies for breakout groups or hybrid models if physical space limitations persist.

## Compliance and Policies

1. **Policy Enforcement**:  
   - Develop guidelines to reinforce academic integrity through thoughtful assessment design, including projects requiring reflection on ethical implications of AI work.
   - Ensure all course content complies with accessibility standards (e.g., captions for videos, screen-reader compatible materials).

2. **Syllabus Transparency**:  
   - Create a comprehensive syllabus detailing learning outcomes, grading policies, and other course requirements, and maintain it as a live document on Canvas for regular updates and announcements.
   - Include clear communication channels and student resources to foster transparency throughout the course.
