Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

### 1) Target Student Profile

**Typical Background**
- **Educational Qualifications:** Students generally come from computer science, information technology, data science, or related fields. Most hold bachelor's degrees, pursuing masterâ€™s programs or certifications in data processing and analytics.
- **Practical Experience:** There is a varied mix of experience levels. Some students may be familiar with programming languages (e.g., Python, Java) and foundational databases, while many have minimal hands-on experience with big data technologies (e.g., Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark).
- **Career Aspirations:** Students aim for roles such as data engineers, data scientists, analysts, or specialists in big data applications within industries like finance, healthcare, and technology, focusing on data-driven decision-making and optimizing business processes.

**Prerequisite Knowledge**
- Foundational knowledge in programming concepts, database management, and statistical analysis is crucial yet may not be uniformly present across the cohort. Familiarity with data handling, storage, and processing concepts, along with industry-standard tools, is beneficial.

**Potential Knowledge Gaps and Learning Needs**
- **Technical Skills in Big Data Tools:** Many students lack experience with large-scale data processing frameworks, necessitating introductory instruction and guided hands-on training.
- **Understanding of Data Management Principles:** Gaps exist in data governance, compliance, and ethical considerations, requiring practical illustrative case studies.
- **Performance Optimization Techniques:** Students may struggle to efficiently optimize data processing workflows without targeted training and practical examples.
- **Collaboration and Project Management Skills:** Deficiencies in teamwork and project management skills suggest a need for structured group activities and clear role definitions in collaborative settings.
- **Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving:** Students may find applying critical thinking frameworks to real-world problems challenging, indicating a need for problem-solving exercises.

### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Introductory Module:**
   - Include a foundational module encompassing basic programming, database concepts, and an overview of big data technologies to ensure minimum competency levels among students.

2. **Hands-on Workshops:**
   - Develop workshops that provide practical experience with big data tools, allowing students to build confidence and competence as they engage with theoretical content.

3. **Case Studies and Real-World Applications:**
   - Integrate real-world case studies that highlight data governance, compliance, and ethical considerations, facilitating contextual learning to connect theory with practice.

4. **Structured Collaboration:**
   - Implement structured group projects with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, supported by team-building exercises and management skills training to enhance collaboration.

5. **Transparent Assessment Policies:**
   - Create clear grading rubrics and expectations for individual and team project deliverables, informed by user feedback indicating a need for transparency in assessment policies.
