**Question 4:** What is an effective technique for overcoming overfitting?

  A) Decrease the size of the training dataset.
  B) Increase the number of parameters in the model.
  C) Use techniques like dropout or regularization.
  D) Ignore validation data.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Techniques like dropout and regularization are effective strategies to mitigate overfitting by adding constraints to the model during training.

## Section 16: Questions & Discussion

### Learning Objectives
- Encourage active discussions and inquiries about AI model training and evaluation.
- Identify areas for further exploration in AI model evaluation.
- Facilitate understanding of key evaluation metrics and their implications.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the main goal of model training in AI?

  A) To create a complex model regardless of data
  B) To minimize the loss function and improve predictions
  C) To deploy the model as soon as possible
  D) To only use unsupervised learning techniques

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The main goal of model training is to minimize the loss function of the model, which involves improving its predictions based on input data.

**Question 2:** Which of the following metrics is crucial for evaluating models on imbalanced datasets?

  A) Accuracy
  B) Recall
  C) F1 Score
  D) Mean Squared Error

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The F1 Score provides a balanced measure of precision and recall, making it particularly useful for evaluating models on imbalanced datasets.

**Question 3:** What is overfitting in the context of AI model training?

  A) The model performs poorly on both training and testing data
  B) The model learns noise from the training data instead of general patterns
  C) The model uses too little data for training
  D) The model is unable to learn from any data

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise from the training data rather than general patterns, often resulting in poor performance on unseen data.

**Question 4:** Which learning technique uses labeled data to train AI models?

  A) Supervised Learning
  B) Unsupervised Learning
  C) Reinforcement Learning
  D) Semi-supervised Learning

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Supervised Learning is the technique that utilizes labeled data to teach models to make predictions or classifications.

### Activities
- Conduct a group exercise where students design a small AI model, specifying at least one supervised and one unsupervised learning approach and present their choice of evaluation metrics.
- Create a confusion matrix using a hypothetical dataset and compute accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Discussion Questions
- What factors do you think influence the choice of evaluation metric for a model?
- Can you think of a real-world application where precision is more critical than accuracy?
- How might ethical considerations impact model training and evaluation?
