    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Cross-Validation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: A statistical method used to estimate the skill of machine learning models.
            \item \textbf{Example}: In k-fold cross-validation, the data is split into 'k' subsets. The model is trained on 'k-1' subsets and tested on the remaining one, repeated 'k' times.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Train-Test Split}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Dividing your dataset into two parts: one for training and one for testing the model's performance.
            \item \textbf{Example}: Using 70\% of your data for training and 30\% for testing to avoid overfitting.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: An ensemble method that improves accuracy by reducing variance.
            \item \textbf{Example}: Random forests use bagging to create multiple decision trees from different samples, increasing prediction power.

            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Precision, Recall, and F1-Score}
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}, \quad \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}, \quad \text{F1-Score} = \frac{2 \times \text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{ROC Curve and AUC}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{ROC Curve}: Graphical representation of a model's diagnostic ability plotting true positive rate (TPR) against false positive rate (FPR).
                \item \textbf{AUC}: Indicates how well the model can distinguish between classes; a value of 1 indicates perfect performance.
