### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Fundamental AI Concepts**:
   - Implement interactive elements (e.g., glossaries, explanatory videos) early in the course to clarify key AI terms and principles.

2. **Tool Utilization**:
   - Structure the curriculum to include increasingly complex guided projects, starting with supervised exercises to build students' confidence in using AI tools.

3. **Evaluation and Analysis Skills**:
   - Incorporate real-world data evaluation tasks or case studies to provide practical experience with AI performance metrics.

4. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Design the course to initiate discussions around ethical dilemmas in AI using relevant case studies, supplemented by reflective group discussions.

5. **Collaboration Skills**:
   - Introduce structured team exercises and clear role definitions in group assignments to foster collaboration skills among students from diverse backgrounds.

6. **Access to Resources**:
   - Partner with cloud service providers to ensure that all students have access to essential computational tools and resources, leveling the playing field for all learners.

By applying these targeted recommendations, the course can more effectively engage students and address their diverse learning needs within the realm of artificial intelligence.
