\frametitle{Course Objectives - Machine Learning & Ethics}
    \begin{block}{Objective 3: Grasp Machine Learning Principles}
        - **Explanation**: Understand the core principles of machine learning, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. \\
        \begin{itemize}
            \item **Supervised Learning**: Training a model on labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices based on historical sales).
            \item **Unsupervised Learning**: Identifying patterns in data without predefined labels (e.g., customer segmentation).
            \item **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and feedback (e.g., training algorithms to play games).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Objective 4: Analyze Ethical Considerations}
        - **Explanation**: Discuss the ethical implications of AI, including bias, job displacement, and privacy concerns. \\
        - **Example**: What biases might be introduced by training facial recognition systems on non-diverse datasets?
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Objective 5: Engage in Project-Based Learning}
        - **Explanation**: Collaborate on projects to apply AI concepts in real-world scenarios. \\
        - **Example**: Developing a simple predictive model for a dataset or creating a chatbot using available AI frameworks.
    \end{block}
