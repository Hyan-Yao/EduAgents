Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: **A1_3_Data_Mining**

## Faculty Expertise Requirements
### Subject Matter Expertise
- **Advanced Knowledge**: The instructor must demonstrate a strong grasp of data mining methodologies, applications, and ethical considerations.
- **Programming Proficiency**: Mandatory expertise in Python; familiarity with additional tools such as R and SQL is beneficial but less critical based on user feedback.
- **Teaching Experience**: Experience in model evaluation techniques and ethical data practices is essential to effectively convey course content.

### Pedagogical Skills
- **Engagement and Collaboration**: The instructor should facilitate group projects and encourage student collaboration, exhibiting strong interpersonal skills.
- **Complex Topic Presentation**: Ability to present sophisticated technical topics, including neural networks and generative models, in an accessible manner for a diverse student body.

## Necessary Computing Resources
### Hardware
- **Student Access**: Each student requires a computer capable of executing Python and related software.
- **Server Capacity**: Additional server resources may be needed for large datasets, particularly for deep learning implementation.

### Software Requirements
- **Primary Language**: Python with the essential libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow) must be pre-installed.
- **Supplementary Tools**: Enhance learning by encouraging familiarity with R or SQL, although they are not mandatory.
- **Collaboration Platform**: Identify a suitable collaborative tool (excluding GitHub) for group project work.

## Scheduling or Facility Limitations
### Classroom Resources
- **Technology Provision**: Ensure the classroom has necessary technology (projectors, computers) for effective lectures and practical sessions.
- **Collaboration Spaces**: Availability of breakout rooms or labs to facilitate collaborative projects.

### TA Support Availability
- Additional teaching assistant support is highly recommended during project work to assist with technical queries and provide feedback.

### Course Schedule
- **Engagement Timing**: Schedule courses considering student availability, avoiding conflicts with finals and major holidays.
- **Class Structure**: Class duration and frequency should be structured to allow sufficient practice and project work.

### Coverage Adjustments
- Revise course content to adequately cover neural networks and deep learning techniques based on feedback from past courses, ensuring content relevance.

## Recommendations for Course Delivery
### Objective Clarification
- Modify learning objectives to focus on Python exclusively while ensuring exposure to various data mining techniques.

### Syllabus Structure
- Adjust the syllabus to integrate model evaluation with classification algorithms, enhancing coherence and aligning with positive user feedback.

### Group Collaboration
- Promote early integration of group projects to emphasize collaborative skills throughout the course, avoiding last-minute consolidation.

### Policies
- Clearly outline course policies, including academic integrity, disability accommodations, and institutional guidelines in the syllabus, implementing improvements based on suggestions.

## Conclusion
Addressing these areas will facilitate effective delivery of the course **A1_3_Data_Mining**, equipping students with critical skills and knowledge while navigating anticipated constraints related to resources and scheduling. Continuous assessment and collaboration among faculty, instructional designers, and administrative staff will be vital to enhancing student learning experiences.
