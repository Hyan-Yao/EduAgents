# Final Project Plan: Analyzing Real-World Data Using Data Mining Techniques

## Project Description
Students will work in small groups to analyze a real-world dataset using data mining methodologies learned throughout the course. The project will culminate in a comprehensive written report and a presentation, allowing students to apply theoretical concepts and develop practical skills while addressing ethical considerations.

## Objectives
1. Apply data mining methodologies to analyze datasets using Python and produce actionable insights.
2. Evaluate and select models based on defined performance metrics, demonstrating an understanding of model evaluation.
3. Collaborate effectively as a group, enhancing communication and project management skills.
4. Articulate the ethical implications relevant to the dataset and methodologies used.

## Timeline with Milestones
1. **Proposal (Due Week 4)**
   - Project proposal outlining the dataset, objectives, and approach.
2. **Milestone 1: Data Preprocessing Report (Due Week 6)**
   - Report on data cleaning and preparation, including identified issues and insights.
3. **Milestone 2: Model Evaluation Report (Due Week 10)**
   - Evaluation report comparing model performance using relevant metrics.
4. **Final Project Submission (Due Week 14)**
   - **Deliverables**:
     - Written Report (maximum 20 pages)
     - Group Presentation (15 minutes)
