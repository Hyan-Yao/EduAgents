|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Quiz on Core Terminology**     | Assess understanding of AI foundational concepts through a short quiz.                             | Week 3           | .pdf (via Canvas LMS)      | 10%         |
| **Group Presentation Outline**    | Submit an outline for the analysis of an AI application, focusing on ethical implications.          | Week 6           | .pdf (via Canvas LMS)      | 10%         |
| **Individual Response Paper**    | Discuss implications of AI in robotics in a short response paper (500 words).                       | Week 5           | .pdf (via Canvas LMS)      | 10%         |
| **Project Proposal**             | Submit detailed project plans including objectives, methodologies, and expected outcomes.           | Week 8           | .pdf (via Canvas LMS)      | 10%         |
| **Mid-Project Peer Evaluation**  | Conduct feedback session on peersâ€™ progress and provide constructive criticism.                      | Week 10          | Peer review form (via Canvas LMS) | 5%       |
| **Case Study Report**            | Analyze a real-world AI application and submit a comprehensive report (1500 words).                | Week 11          | .pdf (via Canvas LMS)      | 15%         |
| **Final Capstone Project**       | A cumulative project where students develop a functional AI model or application.                    | Final Week       | .ipynb or .pdf (via Canvas LMS) | 30%     |
| **Participation and Engagement**  | Participation in class discussions, coding labs, and team activities throughout the course.         | Ongoing          | N/A                         | 10%         |

---

## 2. Cumulative Final Project
The final capstone project tasks students with conceptualizing, designing, and implementing an AI model to address a real-world problem, demonstrating practical applications of course learning objectives.

## 3. Grading Rubrics
### Example: Capstone Project Grading Rubric

| Criteria                  | Excellent (90-100%) | Good (80-89%) | Satisfactory (70-79%) | Needs Improvement (60-69%) | Unsatisfactory (below 60%) |
|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Technical Implementation**  | Code is robust, efficient, and well-documented. All functionalities operate flawlessly. | Code is mostly functional with minor issues. Documentation is understandable. | Code operates but has significant issues. Documentation lacks clarity. | Code has major functionality failures. Documentation is poor or missing. | No functioning code submitted. |
| **Analytical Approach**      | In-depth analysis of problem; clear justification for chosen methods and technologies. | Good analysis with some justification; clear reasoning behind choices. | Surface-level analysis with limited justification. | Weak analysis; choices explained poorly. | No analysis provided. |
| **Presentation Quality**      | Clear, engaging presentation; visuals effectively support content. | Good presentation; visuals needed refinement to enhance understanding. | Presentation is adequate but lacks clarity and engagement. | Poor presentation with minimal organization; visuals were ineffective. | No presentation provided. |
| **Collaboration**             | Team worked cohesively; roles clearly defined; equal contribution confirmed by peers. | Team worked well with minor discord; contributions mostly balanced. | Some collaboration issues; unequal contributions noted. | Little evidence of collaboration; roles unclear. | No evidence of teamwork. |

## 4. Submission Logistics
- All assignments will be submitted electronically via Canvas LMS in specified formats (.pdf for reports and outlines, .ipynb for coding projects).
- Peer evaluations will be conducted through structured forms submitted via Canvas to maintain anonymity.

---

## 5. Feedback and Reflection
Continuous feedback will be integral to the assessments, with constructive feedback provided after each major milestone to encourage reflection, refinement, and skill enhancement.
