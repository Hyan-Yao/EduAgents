    \begin{block}{Key Features}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Intuitive Tensor computation and built-in support for GPU acceleration.
            \item Dynamic computation graph (define-by-run) allowing flexibility in model building.
            \item Strong community support with numerous pre-trained models available.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print("PyTorch Tensor:\n", x)
        \end{lstlisting}
