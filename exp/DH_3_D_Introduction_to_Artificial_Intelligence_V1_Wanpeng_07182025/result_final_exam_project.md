### Collaboration Format
- **Team Composition**: Each team will consist of 4-5 students ensuring diverse skillsets.
- **Individual Contributions**: Team members will have assigned roles (e.g., coding, report writing).
- **Instructor Checkpoints**: Feedback will be provided after project proposal and progress updates.

---

### Submission Logistics
- **Platform**: All submissions will be uploaded via Canvas LMS.
- **File Formats**: Reports as .pdf files, coding prototypes as .ipynb files, presentations as .pdf files.

### Peer and Instructor Feedback
- **Peer Review**: Collected during the final week for teamwork feedback.
- **Instructor Feedback**: Given after each milestone to foster improvement.

---

### Academic Integrity Considerations
- Students must uphold academic integrity, avoiding plagiarism, cheating, and unauthorized collaboration per institutional policies.
