# Final Project Plan Document

## Project Title: **Data Mining for Social Impact**

### Project Overview
This project aims to simulate real-world data mining scenarios where students will work in teams to analyze and extract meaningful insights from a dataset related to social issues, such as public health, education, or environmental sustainability. Students will be required to apply data mining techniques learned in class, critically evaluate their findings, and present their results effectively. 

### Project Objectives
1. **Application of Key Concepts**: Utilize classification, clustering, and anomaly detection to explore the dataset.
2. **Technical Proficiency**: Demonstrate ability in Python/R for data analysis and SQL for data querying.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
4. **Model Building and Evaluation**: Develop and validate models based on the defined objectives.
5. **Ethical Analysis**: Discuss the ethical implications associated with data usage and the findings.
6. **Collaborative Work**: Collaborate effectively within interdisciplinary teams to achieve project goals.
7. **Research and Trends**: Investigate industry trends related to the chosen dataset.
8. **Presentation Skills**: Clearly present findings to a varied audience, emphasizing the social impact of the project.

### Timeline with Milestones

1. **Milestone 1: Project Proposal**  
   - **Due**: Week 3  
   - **Format**: PDF submitted via Canvas LMS  
   - **Content**: Objective and relevance of the study, description of the dataset, proposed data mining techniques, ethical considerations.  
   - **Assessment Rubric**: Clarity (30%), Feasibility (30%), Methodological Soundness (30%), Presentation Quality (10%).

2. **Milestone 2: Progress Update Presentation**  
   - **Due**: Week 10  
   - **Format**: PowerPoint or Google Slides (PDF submission via Canvas)  
   - **Content**: Updates on data preprocessing and model building, challenges faced and solutions implemented, preliminary findings.  
   - **Assessment Rubric**: Engagement (30%), Content Quality (40%), Presentation Skills (30%).

3. **Milestone 3: Final Project Submission**  
   - **Due**: Week 12  
   - **Format**: Final written report (PDF) and presentation.  
   - **Content**: Comprehensive analysis and findings, model performance metrics, discussion on ethical implications, conclusions and recommendations.  
   - **Assessment Rubric**: Analysis Depth (50%), Recommendations (30%), Clarity and Structure (20%).

### Additional Assessment Components
- **Case Study Report**: Analyze a historical case study related to ethical implications in data mining practices (Due Week 8). This will count towards 10% of the overall evaluation.

### Collaborative Nature
- **Team Size**: Groups of 4-5 students.  
- **Roles**: Each member will assume specific roles (Data Analyst, Researcher, Presenter, etc.) for effective collaboration.  
- **Tools**: Collaboration on platforms like GitHub for version control and document sharing.

### Submission Format
- All required deliverables will be submitted via **Canvas LMS**. 
- Expected formats include:
  - PDFs for reports and proposals.
  - Jupyter Notebooks for code submissions (.ipynb).
  - Presentation slides in PDF format.

### Feedback and Assessment Procedures
- **Regular Checkpoints**: Scheduled formative feedback sessions with the instructor after Milestone 1 and Milestone 2.
- **Peer Review**: Teams will engage in peer assessments post-presentation, using a standardized rubric designed to evaluate clarity, content, and coherence.

### Academic Integrity
- Strict adherence to academic integrity is expected. Collaboration must happen within teams, but the work produced must be original. Any violations will result in penalties according to the universityâ€™s policies.

### Conclusion
This project emphasizes real-world applications of data mining techniques while fostering teamwork, critical thinking, and ethical awareness. By the end of the project, students will gain a deeper understanding of data mining concepts and their implications in addressing social challenges.
