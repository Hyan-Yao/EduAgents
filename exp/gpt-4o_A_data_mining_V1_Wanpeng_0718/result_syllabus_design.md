## Course Description

This course provides an in-depth exploration of data mining techniques and methodologies, equipping students with the skills necessary to analyze large datasets, extract meaningful insights, and apply these insights in real-world scenarios. The aim of the course is to develop both theoretical understanding and practical proficiency through hands-on projects, case studies, and collaborative learning.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Articulate key concepts in data mining such as classification, clustering, association rules, and anomaly detection.
2. Demonstrate technical proficiency in data mining software and programming languages (Python, R, SQL).
3. Execute data preprocessing tasks effectively.
4. Build and evaluate various data mining models using relevant performance metrics.
5. Analyze ethical implications in data mining practices through case studies.
6. Apply critical thinking to synthesize and interpret data mining results for data-driven decision-making.
7. Collaborate in teams to complete a data mining project and present findings to diverse audiences.
8. Research current trends and developments in data mining technologies.
9. Understand statistical foundations relevant to data mining.
10. Evaluate the impact of data mining on diverse populations and discuss mitigation strategies for bias.

## Required Readings

1. "Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques" by Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber, and Jian Pei (3rd Edition).
2. "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney.
3. Selected academic papers and case studies (available on the course website).
