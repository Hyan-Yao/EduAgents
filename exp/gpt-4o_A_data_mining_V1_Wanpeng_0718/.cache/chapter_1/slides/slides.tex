    % Key aspects of hypothesis testing
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that uses sample data to evaluate a hypothesis about a population parameter.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Formulate Hypotheses:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Null Hypothesis (H0): No effect or difference.
                \item Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Contradicts H0.
            \end{itemize}
            \textit{Example:} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item H0: The new marketing campaign does not increase sales.
                \item H1: The new marketing campaign increases sales.
            \end{itemize}
            
        \item \textbf{Select Significance Level (\(\alpha\)):} Commonly set at 0.05.

        \item \textbf{Collect Data \& Calculate Test Statistic:} Use appropriate statistical tests.

        \item \textbf{Make a Decision:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item If p-value < \(\alpha\), reject H0.
                \item If p-value \(\geq\) \(\alpha\), fail to reject H0.
