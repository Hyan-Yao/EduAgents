# Assessment and Evaluation Plan for Data Mining Course (DSCI 405)

## Overview
This assessment plan is designed to align with the learning objectives of the Data Mining course, ensuring students engage in project-based, milestone-driven assessments that emphasize real-world applications and analytical thinking.

### Key Components
1. **Project-Based Evaluations**
   - **Group Data Mining Project:** Application of data mining techniques to real-world problems in teams.
   - **Cumulative Final Project:** Comprehensive presentation reflecting all acquired knowledge and skills.

2. **Milestone Breakdown**
   - **Project Proposal:** Initial project outline (Due Week 3).
   - **Progress Report:** Update on project status and challenges (Due Week 10).
   - **Final Project Presentation:** Formal presentation of findings (Due Week 12).
   - **Case Study Report:** Analysis of ethical implications in data mining (Due Week 8).

3. **Question Types**
   - Combination of open-ended questions, analytical tasks, and reflective discussions. Quizzes will include Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess comprehension of key concepts.
