\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics}
    In data mining, evaluating the performance of models is crucial for understanding their effectiveness. Key metrics often used include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Precision}
        \item \textbf{Recall}
        \item \textbf{F1-score}
    \end{itemize}
    These metrics allow us to gauge the quality of predictions, especially in classification tasks.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Performance Metrics - Precision}
    \begin{block}{Precision}
        \textbf{Definition:} Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions. It answers the question: "Of all instances classified as positive, how many were actually positive?"
    \end{block}
    \begin{equation}
        \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{False Positives (FP)}}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a medical test, if we predict 10 patients have a disease and only 7 truly have it, the precision is:
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Precision} = \frac{7}{7 + 3} = 0.70 \text{ or } 70\%
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Performance Metrics - Recall and F1-Score}
    \begin{block}{Recall}
        \textbf{Definition:} Recall (also known as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate) measures the ability of a model to find all relevant cases. It answers: "Of all actual positives, how many did we predict correctly?"
    \end{block}
    \begin{equation}
        \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{False Negatives (FN)}}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Continuing with our medical test, if there are 10 actual patients with the disease, and we detect 7, recall is:
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Recall} = \frac{7}{7 + 3} = 0.70 \text{ or } 70\%
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{F1-Score}
        \textbf{Definition:} The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics, particularly useful when the class distribution is imbalanced.
    \end{block}
    \begin{equation}
        \text{F1-Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Using previous values of precision and recall (both 70%):
        \begin{equation}
            \text{F1-Score} = 2 \times \frac{0.70 \times 0.70}{0.70 + 0.70} = 0.70 \text{ or } 70\%
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Importance of Context:} Different metrics may be more appropriate depending on the problem (e.g., disease detection vs. spam detection).
        \item \textbf{Trade-offs:} Increasing precision may decrease recall and vice versa. The F1-score helps navigate these trade-offs.
        \item \textbf{Use in Decision-Making:} Selecting the right metric is vital for model evaluation and can influence business or operational outcomes.
    \end{itemize}
    By understanding precision, recall, and F1-score, you can better assess the performance of your advanced data mining models and make informed decisions on their deployment and improvement.
