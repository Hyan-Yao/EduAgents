# Final Project Plan Document for D7_2: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Project Overview
The final project will culminate in a collaborative or individual effort applying AI techniques to a real-world problem. This project will allow students to demonstrate their understanding of core AI concepts and the practical application of algorithms learned throughout the course. Each student or group will select a relevant problem domain, propose an AI-based solution, and implement their ideas using the appropriate AI techniques.

## Project Objectives
- Apply core AI concepts like agent architectures, search strategies, logic reasoning, and probabilistic models.
- Demonstrate programming skills through implementation of AI algorithms.
- Develop algorithmic thinking by structuring problems and solutions effectively.
- Analyze and evaluate the performance of AI models in real-world contexts.

## Timeline with Milestones
1. **Project Proposal** (Due Week 6)
   - Format: PDF submission through Canvas.
   - Objectives: Define the problem, outline the proposed solution, and present initial research into existing solutions and methodologies.
   - Points: 5% of total course grade.

2. **Progress Report Presentation** (Due Week 12)
   - Format: Slide deck (PDF) and live presentation.
   - Objectives: Discuss project progress, outline challenges faced, and detail next steps.
   - Points: 5% of total course grade.

3. **Final Project Draft** (Due Week 15)
   - Format: PDF document containing project report, including code links and details on implementation.
   - Objectives: Present a detailed plan, showcasing the practical implementation of the AI model.
   - Points: 5% of total course grade.

4. **Final Project Presentation** (Due Week 16)
   - Format: Live presentation with follow-up Q&A, accompanied by a final report in PDF format.
   - Objectives: Showcase the final AI solution, highlighting its relevance and effectiveness while addressing audience questions.
   - Points: 5% of total course grade.

## Deliverables
- **Proposal Document**: Clear, structured outline including introduction, methodology, and expected outcomes.
- **Progress Report**: Slide deck summarizing progress, challenges, and next steps.
- **Final Project Draft**: Comprehensive report including code details and implementation analysis.
- **Final Presentation**: Live demonstration of the AI solution and a Q&A session supported by a final report.

## Submission Formats
- All submissions will be made via ASU's Canvas LMS.
- Students will use Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) for coding tasks during project implementation.
- Final deliverables will include written reports and presentations in PDF format.

## Academic Integrity Guidelines
- Strict adherence to ASU's Academic Integrity Policy is required. All submitted work must reflect individual or collaborative efforts authentically.
- Turnitin checks will be used to ensure originality in written submissions.
- Collaborative projects must have clearly defined contributions to avoid conflicts of interest.

## Conclusion
This final project aims to substitute traditional exams with an applied approach, reflecting real-world challenges in AI and requiring students to synthesize knowledge from the course while promoting critical thinking and collaboration.
