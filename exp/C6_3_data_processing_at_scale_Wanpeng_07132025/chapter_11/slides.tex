    \frametitle{Understanding Data Privacy - Definition}
    \begin{block}{Definition of Data Privacy}
        Data privacy refers to the management of personal information that organizations collect, store, and use. 
        It encompasses practices and policies that ensure individuals have control over their personal data and how it is processed. 
        Data privacy is crucial in maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of personal information, allowing individuals to safeguard against unauthorized access and misuse.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Elements of Data Privacy:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Consent:} Individuals must provide explicit permission for their data to be collected and used.
            \item \textbf{Transparency:} Organizations must be clear about what data is collected, how it will be used, and who it will be shared with.
            \item \textbf{Security Measures:} Robust protocols must be in place to protect data from breaches and unauthorized access.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Understanding Data Privacy - Significance}
    \begin{block}{Significance within Data Governance}
        Data governance is a framework that ensures the effective management of data across an organization. 
        It establishes policies, standards, and procedures to guarantee the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data. 
        Understanding data privacy is a cornerstone of effective data governance, as it helps organizations:
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Build Trust:} Shows commitment to protecting user data, fostering trust among customers and stakeholders.
        \item \textbf{Mitigate Legal Risks:} Complying with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) reduces the risk of fines and legal repercussions.
        \item \textbf{Enhance Data Quality:} Clear policies improve data quality, leading to better decision-making based on accurate and reliable information.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Data Privacy - Examples}
    \begin{block}{Examples of Data Privacy in Action}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Smartphones:} 
            When a user installs a new app, they often see requests for permissions to access contacts, location, and camera.
            Responsible apps clarify the purpose for these requests, ensuring user consent and data privacy.
            
            \item \textbf{Online Services:} 
            E-commerce platforms use encrypted connections (SSL) for transactions, safeguarding user credit card information during purchases.
