### 2) Data-driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Incorporate Practical Labs:**
   - Schedule regular hands-on lab sessions that facilitate direct interaction with big data frameworks (Hadoop, Spark) and cloud services to reinforce theoretical knowledge.

2. **Integrate Ethics and Governance Modules:**
   - Develop explicit course modules that focus on data ethics, including real-world case studies to frame discussions on governance and compliance issues, ensuring students recognize the importance of ethical data use.

3. **Facilitate Collaboration through Group Projects:**
   - Design structured collaborative assignments that require teamwork and communication, providing opportunities for students to experience project management and collective problem-solving akin to industry environments.

4. **Enhance Continuous Assessment and Feedback:**
   - Introduce systematic feedback mechanisms, including regular reviews and assessments to address knowledge gaps proactively. Implement peer evaluation systems to promote collaborative learning and critical thinking.

5. **Adapt Course Content to Address Knowledge Gaps:**
   - Tailor course content to bridge identified knowledge gaps, such as integrating focused sessions on applying machine learning techniques at scale and reinforcing concepts of data governance and architectural frameworks for processing large datasets effectively. 

By applying these adjustments, the course "C6_3_data_processing_at_scale" will better align with student needs, enhance their learning experience, and prepare them for future careers in the evolving data landscape.
