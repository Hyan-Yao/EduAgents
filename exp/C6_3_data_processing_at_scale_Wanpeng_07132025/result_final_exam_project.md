Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan: Data Processing at Scale

## Project Description
This project aims to replace the traditional final exam with a collaborative assessment focused on solving a real-world problem using big data processing frameworks and machine learning techniques. Students will analyze an authentic dataset, design a scalable data processing architecture, implement machine learning models, and examine ethical implications.

## Objectives
1. Identify and explain the challenges presented by the chosen dataset.
2. Utilize and compare at least three data processing frameworks (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, cloud-based services).
3. Build, evaluate, and optimize machine learning models using large datasets.
4. Develop a comprehensive data processing architecture.
5. Critically apply ethical considerations regarding data privacy and governance.
6. Work effectively within a team to present findings clearly.

## Academic Integrity Guidelines
Students must adhere to academic integrity standards by properly referencing all sources. Collaborative artifacts submitted must comply with the institutionâ€™s guidelines to avoid plagiarism and maintain ethical research practices. All team members should contribute equitably, and individual contributions may be assessed using peer evaluations if necessary.
