   Imagine an Agile team conducting exploratory data analysis (or EDA) during a sprint. Based on initial findings from this phase, they can adjust their focus for the next sprint to dig deeper into the most pertinent areas of interest. This leads to more nuanced insights and ultimately, better decision-making.

2. **Building MVPs (Minimum Viable Products):** 
   Another example would be a data project team that develops a Minimum Viable Product dashboard to visualize essential metrics. They can then collect valuable stakeholder feedback before committing to full-scale development of a more comprehensive solution. This approach safeguards resources while ensuring alignment with user expectations.

Let’s now summarize some of the key points we’ve discussed.

#### Frame 5: Key Points to Emphasize
As we reflect on Agile methodologies, here are a few important takeaways:
