            \item \textbf{Example:} 
            If an autonomous vehicle makes a decision that harms a pedestrian, it's essential to determine whether the blame lies with the developer, the data, the algorithm, or the operator of the vehicle.
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{Key Point:} Establishing clear accountability frameworks is necessary to address the potential consequences of RL actions.
