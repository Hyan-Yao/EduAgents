## Section 1: Introduction to Foundations of Reinforcement Learning

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the foundational components of reinforcement learning, specifically agents, environments, rewards, and policies.

  A) To explore the environment
  B) To maximize cumulative rewards
  C) To modify the environment
  D) To minimize actions taken

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The primary goal of an agent in reinforcement learning is to take actions that maximize cumulative rewards over time.

**Question 2:** How do rewards influence an agent's behavior?

  A) They serve as a reward system for discipline
  B) They provide feedback to enhance decision making
  C) They have no impact on learning
  D) They are only used for punishment

  A) A fixed set of actions for all states
  B) A strategy that maps states to actions
  C) The maximum reward achievable
  D) An algorithm to change the environment
