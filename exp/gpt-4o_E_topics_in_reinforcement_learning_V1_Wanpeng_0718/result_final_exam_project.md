Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan: Capstone in Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview
This capstone project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of students' understanding and application of reinforcement learning (RL) concepts. Teams will identify a real-world problem solvable through RL, design, implement, and present an RL solution while engaging with ethical considerations.

---

## Project Objectives
1. Apply core reinforcement learning algorithms to solve a real-world problem.
2. Create and analyze simulations using both traditional RL and deep RL techniques.
3. Assess the ethical implications of the proposed RL solutions in a real-world context.
4. Enhance teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills through collaborative project development.
