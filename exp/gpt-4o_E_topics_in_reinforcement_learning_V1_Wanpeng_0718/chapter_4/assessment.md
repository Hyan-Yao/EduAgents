### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the primary focus of Week 4?

  A) Machine Learning
  B) Value Functions
  C) Data Structures
  D) Network Protocols

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The primary focus of Week 4 is understanding Value Functions and Bellman Equations.

**Question 2:** What does the State Value Function (V(s)) represent?

  A) Expected immediate reward from action a
  B) Expected return from state s following policy π
  C) Future rewards without any policy
  D) All possible actions in state s

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The State Value Function (V(s)) represents the expected return when starting from state s and following a particular policy π.

**Question 3:** What is the purpose of the discount factor (γ) in the Bellman Equation?

  A) To increase the value of future rewards
  B) To ignore rewards received immediately
  C) To weigh the importance of future rewards
  D) To determine the optimal policy

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The discount factor (γ) is used to weigh the importance of future rewards, ensuring that more immediate rewards are valued higher than distant rewards.

**Question 4:** How does the Bellman Equation aid in the decision-making process of agents?

  A) It creates a static model of the environment
  B) It provides a recursive relationship to compute values
  C) It eliminates any randomness in actions
