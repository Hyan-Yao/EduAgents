## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Reinforcement Learning (RL), a key area in artificial intelligence that focuses on how agents should take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Students will learn essential RL concepts, algorithms, and applications, with both theoretical foundations and practical programming tasks.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. **Understand Fundamental Concepts**: Articulate key RL concepts, including agents, environments, rewards, policies, and the exploration vs. exploitation problem.
2. **Apply Algorithms**: Implement and evaluate core RL algorithms (Q-learning, SARSA, policy gradients).
3. **Formulate Problems**: Translate real-world problems into RL frameworks and assess the effectiveness of proposed solutions.
4. **Understand Theoretical Foundations**: Demonstrate knowledge of Markov decision processes and Bellman equations through assessments.
5. **Explore Deep RL**: Utilize neural networks for value and policy functions, applying techniques like DQN, A3C, and PPO.
6. **Discuss Ethical Considerations**: Analyze ethical implications of RL applications.
7. **Research Applications**: Investigate current trends and applications in RL, and present findings.
8. **Develop Collaboration Skills**: Work effectively in teams and communicate technical findings clearly.
9. **Complete a Capstone Project**: Design and implement a project that showcases learned RL methods.
10. **Promote Lifelong Learning**: Identify resources for continued learning in RL.
