    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Formula for Reward Evaluation}
        In RL, the reward signal \( R(s, a) \) must be carefully considered to avoid negative biases:
        \begin{equation}
            R = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t r_t
        \end{equation}
        where \( \gamma \) is the discount factor for long-term considerations.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Code Snippet for Monitoring Bias}
        Consider implementing fairness audits:
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
def check_fairness(predictions, labels):
    # Analyze predictions for bias across different groups
    return disparities
        \end{lstlisting}

    \frametitle{Policy Improvements through Exploration - Overview}
    In Reinforcement Learning, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. A crucial aspect of this learning process is balancing \textbf{exploration} and \textbf{exploitation}. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration}: Trying out new actions to discover their effects.
        \item \textbf{Exploitation}: Leveraging known actions that yield the best rewards.
    \end{itemize}
    Effective exploration strategies are essential for improving RL policies and enhancing performance.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Policy Improvements through Exploration - Importance}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Discovery of Better Policies}: Exploration allows agents to find actions that lead to higher rewards, avoiding convergence on suboptimal solutions.
        \item \textbf{Avoiding Local Optima}: Sole dependence on exploitation may lead to getting stuck in local optima. Exploration helps in escaping these suboptimal solutions.
        \item \textbf{Improving Robustness}: Diverse experiences gained from exploration make policies more adaptable to changing environments or tasks.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Policy Improvements through Exploration - Strategies}
    \textbf{Types of Exploration Strategies:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Epsilon-Greedy}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Description}: With probability $\epsilon$, the agent selects a random action; otherwise, it picks the best known action.
                \item \textbf{Example}: Setting $\epsilon$ to 0.1 gives a 10\% chance of random actions.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Softmax Action Selection}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Description}: Actions are selected probabilistically based on estimated values.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Description}: Prioritizes actions with the greatest uncertainty and potential reward.
                \item \textbf{Formula}:
                \begin{equation}
                    UCB(a) = \bar{Q}(a) + c \sqrt{\frac{\ln t}{n(a)}}
                \end{equation}
                where:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item $\bar{Q}(a)$ is the average reward of action $a$.
                    \item $t$ is the total number of actions taken.
                    \item $n(a)$ is the number of times action $a$ has been selected.
                    \item $c$ is a constant controlling exploration.
                \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Transfer Learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL)}
    % Introducing the concept and benefits of transfer learning in RL
    \begin{block}{Introduction}
        **Transfer Learning** is a machine learning technique where knowledge gained while solving one problem is applied to a different, but related problem.
    \end{block}
    In RL, this involves leveraging pre-trained models or experiences from one environment (source domain) to enhance learning in a new, potentially similar environment (target domain).
\end{frame}

        \item \textbf{Generalization}: Better generalization across different environments, allowing agents to adapt more easily to varying conditions.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Example Case}
    % Illustration of transfer learning in a robotic arm scenario
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Consider a robotic arm trained to pick up objects in a simple environment (source task). If we later want it to work in a more complex environment with different objects (target task), we can transfer the learned policies for object manipulation. This way, the robotic arm can quickly adapt and learn to navigate the new challenges more efficiently.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Transfer learning can reduce the amount of data required for training on the new task.
        \item Agents can leverage learned experiences to handle unknown situations more effectively.
        \item Implementing transfer learning requires careful consideration of the relatedness of tasks and environments.
    \end{itemize}
