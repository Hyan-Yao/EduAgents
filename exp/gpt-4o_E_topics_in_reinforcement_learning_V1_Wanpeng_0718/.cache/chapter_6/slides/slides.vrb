    \begin{block}{Objective}
        The agent seeks to learn an optimal policy (\(\pi\)) that maximizes the expected cumulative reward, represented as:
        \begin{equation}
            R = r_1 + \gamma r_2 + \gamma^2 r_3 + ... + \gamma^{t-1} r_t
        \end{equation}
        where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \(r_t\) is the reward at time \(t\),
            \item \(\gamma\) (0 â‰¤ \(\gamma\) < 1) is the discount factor prioritizing immediate rewards.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
