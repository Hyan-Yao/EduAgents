    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mastery of these concepts is essential for understanding reinforcement learning.
        \item They lay the groundwork for the development of RL algorithms.

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Exploration vs. Exploitation - Overview}
    In reinforcement learning (RL), agents face the critical choice of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration}
        \item \textbf{Exploitation}
    \end{itemize}
    This balance affects the efficiency and effectiveness of learning.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding the Dilemma}
    \begin{block}{Exploration}
        Involves trying new actions to discover potential rewards.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example: A child trying different ice cream flavors to find new favorites.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Exploitation}
        Selecting actions known to yield the highest rewards based on past experiences.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Example: Choosing chocolate ice cream, already known to be a favorite.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Importance of the Dilemma}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Balancing Act:} Finding the right mix between exploration and exploitation is crucial. 
        \item \textbf{Long-Term vs. Short-Term:} Weighing long-term benefits of exploration against short-term profits of exploitation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Strategies to Address the Dilemma}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item With probability $\epsilon$, choose a random action (explore); with probability $1-\epsilon$, choose the best-known action (exploit).
            \item Example: In a Q-learning agent, start with $\epsilon = 0.1$ (10\% exploration).
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)}
        \begin{equation}
            A_t = \arg \max_a \left( \hat{Q}(a) + c \sqrt{\frac{\ln(t)}{N(a)}} \right)
        \end{equation}
        
        \item \textbf{Softmax Action Selection}
        \begin{equation}
            P(a) = \frac{e^{Q(a)/\tau}}{\sum_{b} e^{Q(b)/\tau}}
        \end{equation}
        where $\tau$ is the temperature parameter controlling exploration.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points and Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Finding the Balance:} Agents must manage exploration and exploitation adaptively for optimal learning.
        \item \textbf{Dynamic Adjustment:} Strategies can evolve, shifting from exploration to exploitation as knowledge increases.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        The exploration vs. exploitation dilemma is vital in reinforcement learning, impacting agents' decision-making and overall performance.

    \frametitle{Introduction to Key Reinforcement Learning Algorithms}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reinforcement Learning (RL) involves agents making decisions through interactions with environments.
        \item This presentation will cover three popular RL algorithms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Q-learning
            \item SARSA
            \item Policy Gradients
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Q-Learning}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        Q-learning is a model-free RL algorithm focused on action-value learning, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{How it Works}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Uses a Q-table to store values of state-action pairs.
            \item Updates Q-values using the Bellman equation:
            \begin{equation}
            Q(s, a) \gets Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
            \end{equation}
            Where:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $Q(s, a)$ = current estimate of the Q-value for state $s$ and action $a$
                \item $r$ = reward after taking action $a$
                \item $\gamma$ = discount factor (0 ≤ $\gamma$ < 1)
                \item $\alpha$ = learning rate (0 < $\alpha$ ≤ 1)
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a grid world, an agent learns to navigate to a goal, updating the Q-values based on rewards received after each move.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{2. SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        SARSA is an on-policy RL algorithm that evaluates and improves the policy being used to make decisions.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{How it Works}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Similar to Q-learning; however, it updates Q-values based on the action actually taken.
            \item The update rule is:
            \begin{equation}
            Q(s, a) \gets Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
            \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a grid world, SARSA learns from actions taken during exploration, potentially leading to safer paths with less profit than riskier options.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{3. Policy Gradients}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        Policy gradient methods directly parameterize the policy and optimize it using gradient ascent, negating the need for value function approximation.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{How it Works}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The policy is represented as a neural network.
            \item The update rule is:
            \begin{equation}
            \theta \gets \theta + \alpha \nabla J(\theta)
            \end{equation}
            Where:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $\theta$ = parameters of the policy
                \item $J(\theta)$ = expected return of the policy
                \item $\nabla J(\theta)$ = gradient of performance measure w.r.t. policy parameters
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a game, the agent adjusts its actions based on expected outcomes during training instead of just aiming to maximize rewards.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation}: Each algorithm navigates this balance differently.
        \item \textbf{Applicability}: Different algorithms suit different types of problems; understanding the environment aids in choosing the right algorithm.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion and Next Steps}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These foundational algorithms form the backbone of many RL applications.
        \item Next, we will explore real-world applications in fields such as robotics, gaming, finance, and healthcare.
