        The key equation in Q-learning is given by:
        \begin{equation}
        Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
        \end{equation}
        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $Q(s, a)$ is the current estimate of the Q-value for state $s$ and action $a$.
            \item $\alpha$ is the learning rate (0 < $\alpha$ ≤ 1).
            \item $r$ is the reward received after executing action $a$ in state $s$.
            \item $\gamma$ is the discount factor (0 ≤ $\gamma$ < 1).
            \item $s'$ is the next state after taking action $a$.
            \item $\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$ is the maximum estimated future rewards from the next state $s'$.
        \end{itemize}
