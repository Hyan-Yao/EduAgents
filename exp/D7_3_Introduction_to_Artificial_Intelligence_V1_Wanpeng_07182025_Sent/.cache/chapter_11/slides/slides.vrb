    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Examples of Presentation Techniques:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Use visual aids to demonstrate data trends clearly; for example:
            \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def calculate_average(data):
    return sum(data) / len(data)
            \end{lstlisting}
            \item Use metaphors to simplify complex subjects. For instance, explaining a neural network using the analogy of the human brain can aid understanding for non-experts.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Final Thoughts:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Set specific, measurable goals for your next presentation (e.g., improve eye contact, use more storytelling).
            \item Record practice sessions to observe and refine your body language and vocal delivery.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Encouragement:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Remember, mastering presentation skills is a gradual journey. Celebrate small victories and remain committed to your growth as a presenter.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
