Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan: AI in Real-World Applications

## Project Overview
This collaborative project-based final assessment will replace the traditional exam for the "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" (D7_3) course. Students will work in teams to tackle a real-world AI problem by applying systematic problem-solving, advanced techniques in AI, and ethical considerations. The project will culminate in a comprehensive report and presentation that reflects their understanding of course objectives and their ability to communicate complex ideas effectively.

## Project Objectives
- Apply AI techniques to solve real-world challenges systematically.
- Implement advanced technical skills in machine learning, NLP, and data analysis.
- Critically evaluate AI methods, understanding uncertainties in decision-making.
- Collaborate effectively in interdisciplinary teams and communicate findings to diverse audiences.
- Assess ethical implications of AI solutions in real-world scenarios.

## Grading Rubric
- Each milestone will be assessed on a 1-5 scale against listed criteria.
- Total percentages for each milestone:
  - Project Proposal: 5%
  - Midterm Progress Report: 10%
  - Final Presentation: 15%
  - Final Report: 20%
  - Cumulative Reflection: 15%

## Submission Formats
- All submissions will be made through Canvas LMS.
- File Formats:
