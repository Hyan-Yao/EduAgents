    \frametitle{Understanding Bias in AI}
    \begin{block}{Definition of Bias in AI}
        Bias in artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systematic errors leading to unfair outcomes, favoring certain individuals or groups. This bias can manifest as skewed results, unfair treatment, or discriminatory practices against specific demographics.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{How Bias Occurs in Machine Learning Algorithms}
    Bias in AI systems can occur through several routes:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Data Selection Bias}: When training data is unrepresentative.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Example:} Facial recognition AI trained mainly on light-skinned individuals performs poorly on darker-skinned individuals.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Measurement Bias}: Inaccuracies in data collection across groups.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Example:} Healthcare AI trained on predominantly male data may mispredict health outcomes for women.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Algorithmic Bias}: Bias introduced through the design of the algorithm itself.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Example:} An AI could assign different weights based on flawed logic, promoting bias against underrepresented features.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Address Bias in AI}
