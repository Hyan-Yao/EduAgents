\frametitle{Conclusion and Future Directions - Key Questions for Reflection}
    Consider the following as we move forward:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item How can we ensure fairness and reduce bias when deploying unsupervised learning models?
        \item In what ways can novel architectures like large transformers change the landscape of unsupervised learning applications?
        \item What ethical frameworks should guide the use of unsupervised learning in sensitive areas such as healthcare and criminal justice?
    \end{enumerate}

    By reflecting on these questions, we can appreciate the vast potential unsupervised learning holds for future innovations in data science and artificial intelligence.
