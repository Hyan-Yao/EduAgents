    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations in AI - Data Privacy}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Data privacy refers to the proper handling of sensitive information, ensuring that individuals' personal data is collected, processed, and stored with their consent and in a secure manner.
    \end{block}
    
    \textbf{Example:} Think about a health app that tracks your daily activities and provides health recommendations. If this app collects your health data without clear consent or does not secure this data properly, it could lead to privacy breaches.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Informed Consent:} Users should know what data is being collected and how it will be used.
        \item \textbf{Data Security:} Strong encryption methods should be employed to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
    \end{itemize}
