        Data privacy involves the proper handling of sensitive information, ensuring protection against unauthorized access and misuse.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Key Points:**
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Informed Consent: Users should be aware of data usage.
            \item Anonymization: Techniques to anonymize data protect identities.
            \item Compliance: Adhere to regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
        \end{itemize}
        \item **Example:** A health app collects user data; it must ensure informed consent and secure data storage.
