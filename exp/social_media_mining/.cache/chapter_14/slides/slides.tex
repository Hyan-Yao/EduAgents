\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Case Study 1: Facebook's Cambridge Analytica Scandal}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Background}: In 2016, data from over 87 million Facebook users was harvested without consent by Cambridge Analytica for political advertising.
        \item \textbf{Ethical Dilemma}: The main dilemma revolved around user privacy and consent. Users were unaware their data was being used for political manipulation.
        \item \textbf{Resolution}: After public backlash, Facebook implemented stricter data privacy policies and introduced features to allow users to control their data. 
        This highlighted the importance of transparency and user consent in data use.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Ethical Challenges in Social Media Research}
    As researchers harness social media data for insights, they encounter several ethical challenges that must be navigated carefully. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Privacy and Consent}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Concept:} Users often do not anticipate that their social media activity may be used for research, raising concerns over informed consent.
        \item \textbf{Example:} Studying public posts may seem permissible, but using private messages or gathering sensitive information without consent violates ethical norms.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Key Point:} Always obtain explicit consent; respect user privacy regardless of data accessibility.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{2. Data Ownership and Attribution}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Concept:} Conflicts arise over data ownership once it is shared online.
        \item \textbf{Example:} Using tweets without acknowledging original authors can result in ethical dilemmas.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Key Point:} Acknowledge data sources ethically, considering implications of sharing findings.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{3. Potential for Misuse of Data}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Concept:} Researchers must consider how their findings could be misinterpreted or misused.

    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Key Point:} Ensure transparency in methodology and interpretation to mitigate misuse risks.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{4. Bias and Representativity}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Concept:} Platforms may have demographic disparities leading to non-representative samples.
        \item \textbf{Example:} Twitter analysis may reflect insights of younger, urban populations, failing to represent rural or older groups.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Key Point:} Acknowledge sample limitations and strive for representativeness in findings.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{5. Emotional and Psychological Impact}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Concept:} Researching sensitive topics can affect users emotionally, necessitating consideration of impact on participants.
        \item \textbf{Example:} Mental health trend research could inadvertently distress users discussing these issues.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Key Point:} Handle sensitive topics with care; provide resources for support as needed.
