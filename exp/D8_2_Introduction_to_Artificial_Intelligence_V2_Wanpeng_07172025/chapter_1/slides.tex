\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)}
    \frametitle{Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        A \textbf{Markov Decision Process (MDP)} is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making environments where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of an agent. 
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Foundation of reinforcement learning and AI.
        \item Models sequential decision-making problems.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Components of MDPs}
    \frametitle{Components of MDPs}
    An MDP consists of:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{States (S)}: Set of all possible situations.
        \item \textbf{Actions (A)}: Set of all possible actions the agent can take.
        \item \textbf{Transition Model (P)}: Probability of state transition given an action.
            \begin{equation}
                P(s' | s, a)
            \end{equation}
        \item \textbf{Rewards (R)}: Feedback on actions, typically scalar values.
        \item \textbf{Discount Factor ($\gamma$)}: Value between 0 and 1 that discounts future rewards.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Closer to 0 favors immediate rewards.
            \item Closer to 1 values future rewards similarly to immediate ones.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The Role of MDPs in Decision-Making}
    \frametitle{The Role of MDPs in Decision-Making}
    MDPs:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Provide a structure for modeling complex decision-making processes.
        \item Allow agents to evaluate strategies for maximum cumulative rewards.
        \item Manage uncertainty in outcomes, suitable for real-world applications.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Example of MDP in Use}
    \frametitle{Example of MDP in Use}
    Consider a robot navigating a maze:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{States (S)}: Each position in the maze (start, goal, walls).
        \item \textbf{Actions (A)}: Move up, down, left, right.
        \item \textbf{Transition Model (P)}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item 90\% chance to move left, 10\% to hit a wall.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Rewards (R)}: +50 for reaching the goal, -1 for each move.
        \item \textbf{Discount Factor ($\gamma$)}: Set to 0.9.
    \end{itemize}
    The MDP framework helps the robot determine the optimal path in the maze.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Key Points to Emphasize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards through trial and error.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Key Concepts in RL}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Agent}: The learner or decision-maker.
            \item \textbf{Environment}: Everything the agent interacts with, providing feedback.
            \item \textbf{Action}: A choice made by the agent affecting the environment.
            \item \textbf{State}: The current situation of the agent within the environment.
            \item \textbf{Reward}: Feedback received after an action, indicating its effectiveness.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{How Reinforcement Learning Works}
    \begin{block}{Exploration vs. Exploitation}
        The agent must balance exploring new actions to discover their rewards with exploiting known actions that yield high rewards.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Q-Learning}
        A popular model-free method where the agent updates its knowledge of the value of actions in states:
        \begin{equation}
            Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)\right]
        \end{equation}
        where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $Q(s, a)$ = value of action $a$ in state $s$
            \item $\alpha$ = learning rate
            \item $r$ = reward received after taking action $a$
            \item $\gamma$ = discount factor for future rewards
            \item $s'$ = new state after the action
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
