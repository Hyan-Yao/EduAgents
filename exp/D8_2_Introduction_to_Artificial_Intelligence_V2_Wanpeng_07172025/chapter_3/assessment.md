  A) Alpha-Beta Pruning
  B) Deep Learning
  C) Reinforcement Learning
  D) Decision Trees

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimization technique for the minimax algorithm, significantly improving efficiency by reducing the number of nodes evaluated.

**Question 3:** In what context do cooperative agent strategies typically arise?

  A) Individual board games.
  B) Team sports and collaborative problem-solving.
  C) Competitive tournaments.
  D) Solo competitions.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Cooperative strategies are most commonly found in settings where agents need to work together towards a shared goal, such as in team sports or collaborative tasks.

**Question 4:** What is a potential future trend in game AI mentioned in the chapter?

  A) Simplifying classic games.
  B) Enhancing machine learning techniques within multi-agent frameworks.
  C) Eliminating competitive gameplay.
  D) Focusing solely on single-agent systems.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Future trends in game AI include enhancing machine learning techniques within multi-agent frameworks to create more adaptable and intelligent agents.
