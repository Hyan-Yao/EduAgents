    \frametitle{Importance of Game Theory in AI}
    \begin{block}{Overview of Game Theory}
        Game theory is a mathematical framework that studies strategic interactions among rational decision-makers. In the context of AI, it models and analyzes scenarios where agents (players) make decisions affecting their own outcomes and those of others.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Players}: Individuals or entities making decisions (e.g., two opponents in chess).
        \item \textbf{Strategies}: Plans of action available to players (e.g., different moves in a game).
        \item \textbf{Payoffs}: Outcomes resulting from players' strategies, often represented in a matrix.
        \item \textbf{Nash Equilibrium}: A situation in a game where no player can benefit from changing their strategy while others hold constant.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Role of Game Theory in AI}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Strategic Decision-Making}: AI can use game theory to anticipate competitors' moves, especially in economics, auctions, and competitive games.
        
        \item \textbf{Multi-Agent Systems}: Game theory informs decision-making among multiple autonomous agents, such as in cooperation or competition.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Examples in AI Applications}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Robotics}: Coordinating multiple robots to achieve common goals (e.g., delivery, exploration) without interference.
        
        \item \textbf{Economics and Auctions}: Analyzing bidding strategies to predict competitors' behavior for maximizing revenue.
        
        \item \textbf{Games}: Algorithms for games like Chess or Go use game theory to predict opponent moves and devise strategies.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Players}: X and O.
        \item \textbf{Strategies}: Each player has multiple possible moves per turn.
        \item \textbf{Payoffs}: Winning (1), Losing (-1), or Draw (0).
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Nash Equilibrium in Tic-Tac-Toe}
        If both players play optimally, the game results in a draw, reflecting a stable state where neither player can unilaterally change their strategy for a better outcome.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion and Key Points}
    Incorporating game theory into AI enhances agents' ability to make rational decisions in competitive environments. Agents systematically evaluate potential outcomes and strategies, leading to more robust AI applications.
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Game theory serves as the backbone for strategic interaction in AI applications.
            \item Understanding player behavior and strategy optimization is crucial for effective AI decision-making.
            \item Real-world applications extend beyond games to include economics, robotics, and social interactions.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Adversarial Search Fundamentals}
    % Introduction to adversarial search
    Adversarial search is a critical concept in artificial intelligence, particularly in game playing and decision making, involving multiple agents with potentially opposing goals.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts - Players and Strategies}
    \begin{block}{Players}
        - In adversarial games, players are the agents making decisions.\\
        - Each player aims to maximize their chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances.\\
        - \textbf{Example:} In chess, the two players (White and Black) have opposing objectivesâ€”checkmating the opponent's king.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Strategies}
        - A strategy defines the approach a player takes to achieve their goal:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Deterministic:} Fixed actions based on predetermined rules.
                \item \textbf{Randomized:} Using probability to make decisions, which can avoid predictability.
            \end{itemize}
        - \textbf{Example:} In Tic-Tac-Toe, a player might choose a strategy of always taking the center square if available.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts - Outcomes and Importance}
    \begin{block}{Outcomes}
        - Outcomes of an adversarial game can be classified into:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Win:} One player achieves the objective and wins.
                \item \textbf{Loss:} The opponent successfully achieves their goal, resulting in a loss.
                \item \textbf{Draw:} Neither player can claim victory, common in perfect information games.
            \end{enumerate}
        - \textbf{Example:} In connect-four, if neither player can connect four pieces and the board is full, the game ends in a draw.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Importance of Adversarial Search}
        - Adversarial search algorithms evaluate and choose moves based on possible future game states, predicting and countering an opponent's possible moves.
        - Commonly used in strategic games like chess, checkers, and Go.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Minimax Algorithm - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        The \textbf{Minimax Algorithm} is a decision-making strategy used in two-player games to minimize the possible loss in a worst-case scenario. This algorithm is crucial for players in determining the best possible move under the assumption that their opponent plays optimally.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Minimax Algorithm - Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Players}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Maximizer: Aims to maximize their score (represented as â€˜Maxâ€™).
            \item Minimizer: Aims to minimize the score of the maximizer (represented as â€˜Minâ€™).
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Game Tree}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A graphical representation of all possible moves in a game.
            \item Each node represents a game state with branches leading to subsequent game states.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Minimax Algorithm - How It Works}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Tree Construction}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Build a game tree starting from the current state where each level represents a playerâ€™s turn.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Leaf Node Evaluation}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Evaluate the game outcome at leaf nodes (e.g., win, lose, draw) and assign numeric scores (e.g., +1 for win).
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Backpropagation of Values}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Propagate values back up the tree:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Max selects the maximum value.
                \item Min selects the minimum value.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Optimal Move Selection}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The root will have the optimal value, guiding Max in move selection.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Minimax Algorithm - Example Visualization}
    Consider a simplified game decision represented in a tree:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{verbatim}
             Max
            /   \
          Min   Min
         / \     / \
        3   5   2   9
    \end{verbatim}
    \end{center}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Leaf Nodes (evaluated scores): [3, 5] for left and [2, 9] for right.
        \item Min selects:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Left: \textit{min}(3, 5) = 3
            \item Right: \textit{min}(2, 9) = 2
        \end{itemize}
        \item Max selects \textit{max}(3, 5) = 5.
    \end{itemize}
    Hence, the optimal move leads to the branch with value 5.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Minimax Algorithm - Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assumes optimal and rational play from both players.
        \item Computationally intensive due to large branching factors.
        \item Includes enhancements like \textbf{Alpha-Beta Pruning} to improve efficiency by eliminating unnecessary branches.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Minimax Algorithm - Pseudocode}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
function minimax(node, depth, isMaximizingPlayer):
    if (node is a terminal node or depth is 0):
        return evaluate(node)

    if (isMaximizingPlayer):
        bestValue = -âˆž
        for each child of node:
            bestValue = max(bestValue, minimax(child, depth - 1, false))
        return bestValue
    else:
        bestValue = +âˆž
        for each child of node:
            bestValue = min(bestValue, minimax(child, depth - 1, true))
        return bestValue
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Alpha-Beta Pruning}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization technique for the minimax algorithm used in decision-making processes for two-player games. It eliminates portions of the search tree, reducing the number of nodes evaluated.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Minimax Algorithm Recap}: 
          A recursive approach where the maximizer tries to maximize their score while the minimizer seeks to minimize it.
        \item \textbf{Alpha and Beta Values}:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Alpha ($\alpha$)}: The best value that the maximizer can guarantee at that level or above. Initially set to $-\infty$.
            \item \textbf{Beta ($\beta$)}: The best value that the minimizer can guarantee at that level or below. Initially set to $+\infty$.
          \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{How Alpha-Beta Pruning Works}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Node Evaluation}: As nodes are evaluated in the tree, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values are updated.
        \item \textbf{Pruning Decision}: If at any point $\beta \leq \alpha$, further exploration of that branch is not needed, as it cannot influence the final decision.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Efficiency and Example}
    \begin{block}{Efficiency}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Without Pruning}: The minimax algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of $O(b^d)$, where $b$ is the branching factor and $d$ is the depth of the tree.
            \item \textbf{With Alpha-Beta Pruning}: The effective branching factor can be reduced to $O(b^{(d/2)})$, significantly improving performance.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Alpha-Beta pruning enhances the minimax algorithm's efficiency.
            \item It does not compromise the optimality of results, but significantly reduces unnecessary calculations.
            \item Understanding pruning applications is crucial for programmers working with strategic AI.

  \frametitle{Evaluation Functions}
  \begin{block}{Overview}
    Discussing the importance of evaluation functions in estimating game positions.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Understanding Evaluation Functions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{What are Evaluation Functions?} 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Algorithms that assess and estimate the desirability of game positions.
      \item Provide a numerical value indicating how favorable a position is for a player.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Why are Evaluation Functions Important?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Complexity Reduction: Helps intelligently prune moves in vast search spaces.
      \item Heuristic Guidance: Guides search algorithms (e.g., Minimax with alpha-beta pruning) by scoring game states.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Key Components of Evaluation Functions}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Game-specific Heuristics}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Different games need tailored evaluation strategies:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item In chess: material advantage, center control, king safety.
        \item In checkers: center control, piece mobility.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Score Representation}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Positive values favor the maximizing player.
      \item Negative values favor the minimizing player.
      \item A score of zero indicates a neutral position.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Example: Chess Evaluation Function}
  \begin{block}{Sample Code}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def evaluate_chess_position(board):
    score = 0

    piece_values = {
        "p": 1,  # pawn
        "N": 3,  # knight
        "B": 3,  # bishop
        "R": 5,  # rook
        "Q": 9,  # queen
        "K": 0   # king (though king safety is crucial)
    }

    for piece in board.pieces():
        score += piece_values.get(piece.type, 0) * (1 if piece.color == "white" else -1)

    return score
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This function evaluates the board by summing up piece values, showing how heuristics can be coded into evaluation functions.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficiency:} Transforms complex search problems into manageable tasks.
    \item \textbf{Customization:} Tailored functions enhance AI decision-making.
    \item \textbf{Not Perfect:} Approximations may fail to capture complete positional values; nuanced positions may require deeper analysis.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{block}{Summary}
    Evaluation functions are crucial for strategic decision-making in game AI. They simplify decision processes, enabling efficient computation and effective gameplay strategies.
