    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Handling Uncertainty:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Real-world scenarios are often uncertain (e.g., weather predictions, stock market behavior, medical diagnoses).
                \item Quantification and management of this uncertainty are critical.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Flexible Modeling:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Represent complex relationships between variables efficiently.
                \item Example: Disease prediction models accounting for symptoms and risk factors.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Incremental Learning:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Systems can update beliefs as new evidence arises.
                \item Essential for applications like recommendation systems and fraud detection.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Key Concepts in Probabilistic Reasoning}
    \begin{block}{Bayes' Theorem}
        A fundamental rule to update probabilities based on new evidence:
        \begin{equation}
            P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}
        \end{equation}
        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $P(A | B)$: Probability of event A given B.
            \item $P(B | A)$: Probability of event B given A.
            \item $P(A)$ and $P(B)$: Independent probabilities of A and B.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Examples of Probabilistic Reasoning in AI}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Spam Detection:} AI uses probabilistic reasoning to evaluate if an email is spam based on keywords and sender reputation.
            \item \textbf{Autonomous Vehicles:} Assess sensory inputs and navigate based on the probabilities of outcomes, like detecting obstacles.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Understanding Probability - Definition}
    \begin{block}{Definition of Probability}
        Probability is a numerical measure that quantifies the likelihood of an event occurring. It ranges from 0 to 1, where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{0} indicates an impossible event.
            \item \textbf{1} indicates a certain event.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    Mathematically, probability \( P(E) \) of an event \( E \) can be defined as:
    
    \begin{equation}
        P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
    \end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Understanding Probability - Role in Uncertainty}
    \begin{block}{Role of Probability in Uncertainty and Reasoning}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Dealing with Uncertainty}: Probability allows us to express uncertainties systematically in complex systems, helping us make informed decisions despite incomplete knowledge.
            
            \item \textbf{Reasoning Under Uncertainty}: In AI and statistical reasoning, probability aids in making predictions based on uncertain information, distinguishing between likely and unlikely events.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Understanding Probability - Key Points and Example}
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Completeness and Coherence}: A good probabilistic model captures all relevant information and remains coherent.
            \item \textbf{Application in AI}: Used in machine learning, robotics, natural language processing, etc. E.g., spam detection uses probabilities to classify emails.
            \item \textbf{Bayesian Perspective}: Allows updating our beliefs in light of new evidence, forming a foundation for Bayesian networks.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
  
    \textbf{Example:} Consider a six-sided die:
    \begin{equation}
        P(\text{rolling a 3}) = \frac{1}{6}
    \end{equation}
    This means thereâ€™s a 16.67\% chance of rolling a 3 on any single roll.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Understanding Probability - Conclusion}
    Understanding probability is integral to making rational decisions in uncertain situations. As we explore further into probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian networks, the principles laid out here will form the basis for more complex models and reasoning strategies.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Terminology}
  \begin{block}{Understanding Key Terms}
    In probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian networks, it is crucial to familiarize ourselves with foundational concepts. 
    We will focus on:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Random Variables
      \item Probability Distributions
      \item Events
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Terminology - Random Variables}
  \begin{block}{1. Random Variables}
    \textbf{Definition}: A random variable is a variable that can take on different values based on the outcome of a random phenomenon, denoted by a capital letter (e.g., $X$, $Y$).
  
    \textbf{Types}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Discrete Random Variables}: Take on a countable number of values (e.g., the roll of a die).
      \item \textbf{Continuous Random Variables}: Can take on an infinite number of values within a range (e.g., weight, height).
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Example}: Let $X$ represent the result of rolling a fair six-sided die. The possible values for $X$ are $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Terminology - Probability Distributions}
  \begin{block}{2. Probability Distributions}
    \textbf{Definition}: A probability distribution describes how probabilities are distributed over the values of a random variable.
  
    \textbf{Types}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Probability Mass Function (PMF)}: For discrete random variables, gives the probability that a random variable equals a specific value.
      \begin{equation}
        P(X = x) = p(x)
      \end{equation}
      \item \textbf{Probability Density Function (PDF)}: For continuous random variables, describes the likelihood of falling within a range.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Example PMF for die:}
    \begin{equation}
      P(X = x) = 
      \begin{cases}
        \frac{1}{6} & \text{if } x \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Terminology - Events}
  \begin{block}{3. Events}
    \textbf{Definition}: An event is a specific outcome or collection of outcomes of a random variable. Events can be:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Simple Event}: A single outcome (e.g., $E = \{4\}$).
      \item \textbf{Compound Event}: Multiple outcomes (e.g., $E = \{2, 4, 6\}$).
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Key Points}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item An event is a subset of the sample space (set of all possible outcomes).
      \item Probability of an event $E$ is calculated as:
      \begin{equation}
        P(E) = \sum_{x \in E} P(X = x)
      \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Note}: For continuous variables, integrate the PDF over the relevant interval.
  \end{block}

        Bayesian Networks are graphical models that represent a set of variables and their conditional dependencies through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). These networks are useful for probabilistic reasoning, allowing us to infer unknown probabilities based on known information.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Components of Bayesian Networks - Nodes}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} A node represents a random variable, which can be:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Binary (true/false)
            \item Discrete (a finite set of values)
            \item Continuous (any value in a range)
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Example:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In a medical diagnosis network, nodes may represent symptoms (e.g., "Cough", "Fever") and diseases (e.g., "Flu", "COVID-19").
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Key Point:} Each node contains information about the variable, represented as probabilities reflecting its possible states.

    \frametitle{Components of Bayesian Networks - Directed Edges and CPTs}
    \textbf{2. Directed Edges:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Directed edges indicate the direction of influence between nodes. An edge from node A to node B implies that A influences B, making B conditionally dependent on A.
        
        \item \textbf{Example:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A directed edge from "Smoke" to "Cough" implies that smoking affects the likelihood of coughing.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Key Point:} Directed edges establish a cause-and-effect relationship, modeling complex interactions.
    \end{itemize}

    \bigskip

    \textbf{3. Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Each node has an associated CPT that quantifies how parent nodes affect it, providing probabilities of each state given the states of its parents.
        
        \item \textbf{Example:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For the "Cough" node with parent "Smoke": 
            \[
            P(Cough | Smoke=True) = 0.8, \quad P(Cough | Smoke=False) = 0.1 
            \]
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Key Point:} CPTs are essential for calculating joint probabilities and making inferences based on observed evidence.

    \frametitle{Overview of Bayesian Networks}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Bayesian Networks (BNs) are graphical models that represent a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each node represents a random variable, while edges denote the dependencies between them.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Applications of Bayesian Networks - Fraud Detection}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Concept}: BNs help identify fraudulent activities by evaluating relationships and probabilities in financial transactions.
        \item \textbf{Example}: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An online payment system notices a sudden large transaction from a different geographical location after a history of small transactions.
            \item The Bayesian network computes the probability of fraud based on past transaction patterns and alerts administrators.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: Adjusting belief thresholds allows organizations to update risk assessments as more data becomes available.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Applications of Bayesian Networks - Risk Management}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Concept}: BNs model uncertainties in various risk factors (e.g., market and credit risks) to support decision-making.
        \item \textbf{Example}: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In insurance, a BN evaluates the likelihood of a claim based on factors like demographics, geographical data, and historical claims.
            \item This modeling helps insurers set premiums according to individual risk profiles.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: Decision-makers use BNs to simulate scenarios, enabling informed risk mitigation strategies.
