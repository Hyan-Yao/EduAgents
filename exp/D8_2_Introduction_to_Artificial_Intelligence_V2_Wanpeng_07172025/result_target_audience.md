Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

### 1) Comprehensive Profile of Target Students

**Student Demographics**:
- **Enrollment**: 100-150 undergraduate students.
- **Background**: 60% domestic, 40% international. Predominantly majoring in Computer Science, with some from Electrical and Industrial Engineering.

**Prior Knowledge**:
- **Programming**: Students generally demonstrate confidence in Python. However, there is variability in experience with AI-specific tools and libraries.
- **AI Concepts**: Familiarity with basic AI concepts varies, with common gaps in:
  - Search strategies
  - Logic reasoning
  - Probabilistic models
- **Mathematics**: Some students lack foundational knowledge in probability theory and discrete mathematics, which are critical for understanding AI algorithms.

**Learning Needs**:
1. **Core AI Concepts**: Foundational knowledge in search algorithms and logic reasoning needs reinforcement.
2. **Practical Application**: Students require more hands-on assignments that connect theoretical concepts with real-world applications.
3. **Problem Solving Techniques**: Students need guidance on complex techniques such as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and reinforcement learning.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Understanding model performance and evaluation metrics needs to be addressed with real-world case studies.
5. **Collaboration and Communication**: Skills workshops are needed for effective group work and technical presentations.
6. **Ethical Considerations**: Engaging discussions on AI ethics to navigate social implications in future careers.

**Barriers to Learning**:
- **Lecture Pacing**: Rapid lecture delivery may impede understanding, particularly in the initial weeks.
- **Language Challenges**: International students may face difficulty with technical terminology, especially in mathematics.

### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Supplemental Instruction**: Introduce additional office hours and workshops for students needing extra help, particularly in the foundational areas of AI and mathematics.

2. **Mixed Assessment Strategies**: Shift focus toward project-based assessments instead of traditional exams. This accommodates diverse learning preferences and encourages practical application of knowledge.

3. **Incremental Learning Strategy**: Gradually build complexity in topics. Start with foundational concepts before advancing to complex algorithms and techniques.

4. **Real-World Applications**: Invite industry professionals for guest lectures to provide context and connection between theory and practice, enhancing student engagement with the material.

5. **Curated Resource Library**: Develop a collection of external resources (tutorials, videos, articles) targeted at difficult concepts and tools for varied learning styles.

6. **Ethics Integration**: Embed discussions on ethical implications throughout the course, using case studies that illustrate real-world scenarios to foster critical thinking.

7. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement structured feedback collection to address pacing issues and clarify complex terminology, promoting an adaptive learning environment.

8. **Collaborative Skills Development**: Offer workshops focused on teamwork strategies and presentation skills tailored for technical subjects to facilitate effective collaboration on group projects. 

By addressing these recommendations, the **D8_2_ Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** course can better align with student needs and aspirations, ultimately enhancing their learning experience and preparing them for successful careers in AI.
