**Explanation:** Reinforcement learning requires agents to balance exploring new actions that may yield better rewards with exploiting known actions that have previously been successful.

### Activities
- Create a flowchart that outlines the key components of MDPs and how they relate to reinforcement learning.
- Design a simple grid-world scenario and develop a plan for how an agent would use an MDP to navigate it.

### Discussion Questions
- In your opinion, which real-world application of reinforcement learning do you find most compelling, and why?
- Discuss the challenges faced in implementing MDPs in complex, dynamic environments.
