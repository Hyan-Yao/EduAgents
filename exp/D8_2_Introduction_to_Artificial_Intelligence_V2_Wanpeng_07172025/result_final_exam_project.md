# Final Project Plan Document

### Project Title: **AI for Social Good: Addressing Real-World Challenges**

---

## Project Description
This project serves as a collaborative, project-based assessment to replace the traditional final exam in "D8_2: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence." Students will work in teams to devise an AI solution addressing a real-world problem, integrating critical thinking, problem-solving, and ethical considerations throughout the process.

---

## Project Objectives
1. Apply AI algorithms to real-world problems.
2. Collaborate effectively in teams to analyze and develop AI solutions.
3. Evaluate the ethical implications of AI technologies.
4. Present findings and solutions clearly and cohesively.
