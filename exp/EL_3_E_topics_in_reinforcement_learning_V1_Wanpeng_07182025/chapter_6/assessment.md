  A) It accelerates learning
  B) It prioritizes immediate rewards over distant future rewards
  C) It ensures all rewards are treated equally
  D) It helps the agent ignore rewards

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The discount factor (γ) is used to prioritize immediate rewards over rewards that are expected to be received in the distant future, guiding the agent's learning process.

  A) It requires a model of the environment to be effective
  B) It is an on-policy learning algorithm
  C) It can learn optimal policies through trial and error
  D) It does not consider future rewards

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Q-Learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that enables agents to learn optimal policies through trial and error, without needing a model of the environment.

**Question 4:** In the Q-Learning formula, what role does α (alpha) play?

  A) It adjusts the scale of rewards received
  B) It represents the current state of the environment
  C) It is the learning rate that determines how much new information overrides old information
  D) It denotes the maximum predicted Q-value for future states

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** α (alpha) is the learning rate in the Q-Learning formula that determines how significantly new information updates the existing Q-value estimates.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamental concepts of Q-Learning, including agents, environments, states, actions, rewards, and Q-values.
- Identify the crucial balance between exploration and exploitation in Q-Learning.
- Apply Q-Learning principles to a practical scenario.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the main purpose of Q-Learning?

  A) To model the environment
  B) To find the optimal action-selection policy
  C) To evaluate the model used
  D) To minimize exploration

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Q-Learning is designed specifically to find the optimal action-selection policy for an agent within its environment.

**Question 2:** What does 'exploration' refer to in Q-Learning?

  A) Following the best-known actions
  B) Discovering new actions and their rewards
  C) Constantly using the Q-values
  D) Ignoring feedback from the environment

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** In Q-Learning, exploration involves trying out new actions to determine their rewards, which is crucial for learning.

**Question 3:** Which of the following accurately describes the Q-value?

  A) The immediate reward for an action
  B) The expected utility of an action in a state
  C) The current state of the agent
  D) The best policy to follow

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The Q-value is a function that estimates the expected utility (or total reward) of performing an action in a given state.

**Question 4:** What role does the discount factor (γ) play in Q-Learning?

  A) It determines the immediate reward only
  B) It weighs future rewards compared to immediate rewards
  C) It increases exploration
  D) It defines the state space

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The discount factor (γ) is crucial in Q-Learning as it adjusts the importance of future rewards relative to immediate rewards.

### Activities
- Implement a simple Q-Learning agent in a provided maze environment. The agent should be able to learn and adapt its policy based on exploration and exploitation strategies.
- Create a visualization of the Q-values for different states and actions as the agent learns. Discuss how these Q-values change over time in relation to the agent’s learning process.

### Discussion Questions
- How does Q-Learning compare to other reinforcement learning algorithms that involve modeling the environment?
- In what scenarios would you prioritize exploration over exploitation, and why?
- Discuss how the choice of the discount factor (γ) might affect an agent's learning outcome.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamental principles of Q-Learning and its significance in reinforcement learning.
- Identify and articulate the key components of the Q-Learning algorithm, including states, actions, Q-values, reward signals, and the learning process.
- Apply the concepts of Q-Learning to practical scenarios, demonstrating how exploration and exploitation influence learning outcomes.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What does the Q-value represent in Q-Learning?

  A) The expected reward of a state
  B) The probability of reaching a state
  C) The expected utility of taking an action in a given state
  D) The number of actions available in a state

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The Q-value quantifies the expected utility of taking a specific action in a given state, which guides the agent's learning process.

**Question 2:** In Q-Learning, what role does the discount factor (γ) play?

  A) It helps the agent ignore immediate rewards.
  B) It emphasizes the importance of future rewards.
  C) It reduces the learning rate over time.
  D) It determines the number of total actions available.

**Correct Answer:** B

  A) Processing power for computation
  B) Maintaining an accurate model of the environment
  C) Balancing exploration and exploitation
  D) Minimizing the learning rate

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Finding the right balance between exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known high-reward actions) is crucial for effective learning in Q-Learning.

**Question 4:** What happens when Q-Learning converges?

  A) The agent stops learning entirely.
  B) The agent optimizes its policy for all state-action pairs.
  C) The agent reduces its exploration rate to zero.
  D) The agent can no longer interact with the environment.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** When Q-Learning converges, it means the Q-values have reached their optimal state, allowing the agent to develop the best possible policy for navigating its environment.

### Activities
