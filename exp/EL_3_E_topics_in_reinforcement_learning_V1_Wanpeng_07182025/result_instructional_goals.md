Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

### Refined Course Learning Objectives for "Topics in Reinforcement Learning":

1. **Understanding Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning**: 
   - Students will clearly define core concepts (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks, Markov Decision Processes) and illustrate their applications in real-world scenarios with specific examples.
   - **Measurable Outcome**: Students will produce a 500-word written assignment that meets criteria for clarity and relevance as defined in the rubric.

2. **Mathematical Foundation of Reinforcement Learning**: 
   - Students will demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of essential mathematical principles underlying reinforcement learning techniques, specifically focusing on probability theory and linear algebra.
   - **Measurable Outcome**: Students will complete a quiz consisting of multiple question types, achieving an average score of 70% or higher, assessed with a detailed rubric.

3. **Case Study Exploration**: 
   - Students will select, analyze, and present findings from three relevant case studies showcasing the application of reinforcement learning algorithms in current industry contexts.
   - **Measurable Outcome**: Students will deliver group presentations graded using a rubric, receiving constructive feedback from peers and the instructor.

4. **Iterative Improvement of Algorithms**: 
   - Students will implement and iteratively refine reinforcement learning algorithms, aiming to improve performance on predetermined benchmark problems defined in the course materials.
   - **Measurable Outcome**: Students will submit a project that documents the algorithm iterations, including quantified performance metrics detailing at least a 15% improvement from the established baseline.

5. **Engagement with Current Research**: 
   - Students will critique and discuss selected peer-reviewed research papers in reinforcement learning, focusing on key findings, challenges, and implications for future research directions.
   - **Measurable Outcome**: Students will actively contribute to seminar discussions, assessed on both the frequency and quality of insights derived from at least two chosen research articles.

6. **Ethical and Practical Implications**: 
   - Students will evaluate the ethical considerations surrounding the deployment of reinforcement learning technologies, grounding their analysis in specific ethical frameworks and current events.
   - **Measurable Outcome**: Students will write an analysis paper discussing three significant ethical implications, assessed with qualitative criteria detailed in the rubric.
