        \item \textbf{Summary Illustration: Grid World}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item TD Learning: Updates state values dynamically as the agent moves.
            \item Monte Carlo: Updates values only after completing an episode (e.g., reaching a goal).
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Conclusion}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Understanding the distinctions between TD Learning and Monte Carlo Methods is vital for building efficient reinforcement learning systems.
            \item The appropriate selection between these methods enhances learning performance in dynamic environments.
        \end{itemize}
