    \begin{block}{Cumulative Reward}
        The agent's goal is to maximize its cumulative reward, represented by:
        \begin{equation}
            R(s, a) = r_t + \gamma r_{t+1} + \gamma^2 r_{t+2} + \ldots
        \end{equation}
        Where $\gamma$ (0 â‰¤ $\gamma$ < 1) is the discount factor determining the value of future rewards.
    \end{block}
