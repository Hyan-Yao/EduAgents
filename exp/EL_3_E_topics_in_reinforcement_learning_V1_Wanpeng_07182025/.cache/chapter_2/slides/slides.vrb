    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Policy Optimization:} Prepares for learning about policy gradient methods.
        \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation:} Strategies for balancing exploration and exploitation.
        \item \textbf{Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs):} Understanding scenarios of incomplete information.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Key Takeaways}
        MDPs are vital for modeling decisions in uncertain environments, guiding agents towards optimal behavior.
    \end{block}

    \begin{equation}
        V^{\pi}(s) = R(s, \pi(s)) + \gamma \sum_{s'} T(s, \pi(s), s') V^{\pi}(s')
    \end{equation}
    This equation shows how expected rewards are calculated over time in MDPs.
