Assessment & Evaluation Planning
================================

# Assessment and Evaluation Plan for "Topics in Reinforcement Learning"

### Course Overview
This course employs project-based assessments that are milestone-driven and relevant to real-world applications, fostering analytical thinking and engagement with current research. Traditional exams are replaced by a cumulative final project integrating all course components.

## Scheduling and Timing

1. **Assignments**: Each weekâ€™s assignment should be submitted by Friday at 5 PM.
2. **Case Study Presentations**: Scheduled for Week 8, allowing for sufficient preparation and collaboration.
3. **Final Project Milestones**: Progress updates due in Weeks 7 and 12; complete project due by the end of Week 14.

---

## Submission Logistics

- **Canvas Learning Management System (LMS)**: All submissions (assignments, case study summaries, and final projects) must be uploaded through Canvas in designated folders.
- **Format Specifications**: 
  - Written assignments and case summaries must be submitted in .pdf format.
  - Code for the final project must be packaged in a Jupyter Notebook saved with the .ipynb extension.
  - Follow specified formatting guidelines for each written component (font size, margins, citation styles).

## Learning Objectives Alignment

This assessment plan aligns with the course learning objectives focusing on:
- Mastery of reinforcement learning concepts and practical implementation.
- Application of mathematical foundations to algorithm refinement.
- Engagement with relevant case studies and current research for increased practical knowledge.
- Critical evaluation of ethical implications surrounding reinforcement learning technologies.

---

## Adaptations for Feedback

- Regular feedback sessions will be scheduled to discuss progress, clarify expectations, and improve assignment clarity.
- Iterative refinement for both written and practical components will foster a rich learning environment and a culture of collaboration and support.

---

## Additional Considerations

- **Inclusivity and Accessibility**: Provide resources or tutorials for students on setting up development environments and coding skills.
- **Grading Policies**: Specify policies on attendance, late submissions, and academic integrity to uphold fairness and transparency.
