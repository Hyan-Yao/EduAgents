                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{Description:} Many RL algorithms function as “black boxes,” complicating the understanding of their decision-making processes.
                    \item \textbf{Example:} RL systems in healthcare can face trust issues when recommending treatment plans without transparent reasoning.
                \end{itemize}
