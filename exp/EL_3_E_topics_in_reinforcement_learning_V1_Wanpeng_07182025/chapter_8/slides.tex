\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning - Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        MDPs provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{States (S):} All possible situations in which an agent can find itself.
        \item \textbf{Actions (A):} Choices available to the agent that influence the outcome of states.
        \item \textbf{Transition Function (T):} Defines the probability of moving from one state to another given an action.
        \[
        T(s, a, s') = P(s' | s, a)
        \]
        \item \textbf{Rewards (R):} A function that assigns a numerical value to each state transition, indicating the immediate benefit of taking an action in a state.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        MDPs are the backbone of many reinforcement learning algorithms, providing the structure for assessing the long-term benefits of actions in a stochastic environment.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning - Q-Learning}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to learn a policy which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Core Idea:} It learns the value of state-action pairs, improving over time based on experiences. The Q-value \( Q(s, a) \) represents the expected utility of taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).
        \item \textbf{Update Rule:}
        \[
        Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[R + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)\right]
        \]
        where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( \alpha \): learning rate (controls how much of the new information to integrate)
            \item \( \gamma \): discount factor (determines the importance of future rewards)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        An agent learns that taking action A in state S1 leads to a reward of 10, updating its Q-value \( Q(S1, A) \). Future explorations might show better rewards in state \( S2 \) after action A, leading to adjusted Q-values.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Q-learning enables the agent to learn optimal policies based solely on received rewards, without needing a model of the environment.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning - Deep Q-Networks (DQN)}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        DQNs extend Q-learning by utilizing deep neural networks to approximate Q-values, enabling the capability of handling high-dimensional state spaces (e.g., video frames in games).
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Working Principle:} The DQN evaluates the Q-value function using neural networks, transforming the Q-learning approach to work effectively in large state-action spaces.
        \item \textbf{Experience Replay:} DQNs use a memory buffer to store previous experiences, allowing for learning from a diverse set of actions.
        \item \textbf{Target Network:} Employs two separate networks (main and target) to stabilize learning; the target network is updated less frequently.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In games like Atari, DQNs learn to play by using screen frames as inputs and providing action outputs based on learned Q-values, such as "move left" or "shoot."
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        DQNs represent a significant step in reinforcement learning, combining deep learning techniques with Q-learning to tackle complex environments.
