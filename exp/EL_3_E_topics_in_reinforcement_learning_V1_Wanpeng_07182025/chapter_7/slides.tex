    \frametitle{Fundamental Concepts in DQN - Introduction}
    Deep Q-Networks (DQN) combine traditional Q-learning with deep learning, enabling agents to make decisions in high-dimensional state spaces, such as those found in video games or robotics.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Fundamental Concepts in DQN - 1. Q-Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to learn the value of an action in a particular state.
        \item \textbf{Core Idea}: The agent learns a function that predicts future rewards based on its actions, improving its decision-making over time.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Q-value Function}
        \[
        Q(s, a) = r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a')
        \]
    \end{block}
    
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(Q(s, a)\): Current expected reward for action \(a\) in state \(s\)
        \item \(r\): Immediate reward received after executing action \(a\)
        \item \(\gamma\): Discount factor (0 < $\gamma$ < 1) determines the importance of future rewards
        \item \(\max_{a'} Q(s', a')\): Maximum expected future reward for the next state \(s'\)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Fundamental Concepts in DQN - 2. Neural Networks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Role of Neural Networks}: In DQN, neural networks approximate the Q-value function due to the limitations of storing Q-values for all state-action pairs in high-dimensional spaces.
        \item \textbf{Architecture}: A typical DQN uses:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input layer that accepts state representations
            \item Several hidden layers that process the information
            \item Output layer corresponding to Q-values for each action
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example}: In a game like Atari, the input could be the pixel values of the game screen, and the ground-truth labels being the Q-values for each action (e.g., left, right, jump).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Fundamental Concepts in DQN - 3. Integration of Q-Learning and Neural Networks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{How It Works}: DQNs utilize deep neural networks to predict the Q-values for each action based on the current state, transcending traditional tabular Q-learning methods.
        \item \textbf{Experience Replay}: DQNs store experiences (state, action, reward, next state) in a replay buffer and randomly sample from it to break correlations and stabilize training.
        \item \textbf{Target Network}: To reduce oscillations and improve stability, DQNs use two identical networks â€” the main and the target network.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Q-update Formula}
        \[
        Q(s, a) \gets Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{target}(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
        \]
        where $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

    \frametitle{Experience Replay - Introduction}
    \begin{block}{Introduction to Experience Replay}
        Experience replay is a fundamental concept in Deep Q-Networks (DQN) that enhances learning efficiency. 
        It allows agents to learn more effectively from past experiences instead of relying solely on a purely online learning approach.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Experience Replay - Concept Explanation}
    \begin{block}{Concept Explanation}
        Experience replay involves storing past experiences, called "transitions," in a replay memory (experience replay buffer).
    \end{block}
    Each transition typically contains:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **State (s)**: The observation from the environment.
        \item **Action (a)**: The action taken by the agent in that state.
        \item **Reward (r)**: The immediate reward received after taking the action.
        \item **Next State (s')**: The state reached after taking the action.
    \end{itemize}
    Random sampling of mini-batches from this memory during training helps to break temporal correlations.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Experience Replay - Benefits and Example}
    \begin{block}{Benefits of Experience Replay}

            \item \textbf{Better Convergence:} Learning from diverse experiences avoids bias towards recent transitions.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example of Experience Replay Implementation}
        Without experience replay, learning can be inconsistent. Hereâ€™s a simplified process:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Store Transition:} After taking action, the transition (s, a, r, s') is stored.
            \item \textbf{Sample Mini-Batch:} Randomly sample mini-batch at each training step.
            \item \textbf{Update DQN:} Use sampled experiences to update the network.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Experience Replay - Key Points}
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}

    \frametitle{Convergence Speed}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Convergence speed is the rate at which the DQN's learning stabilizes, meaning the performance (or Q-values) approaches optimal values.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Faster convergence generally implies a more efficient learning process.
        \item Critical for practical applications with time constraints.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a training scenario:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A DQN that learns the best action policy after 500 episodes demonstrates good convergence speed.
            \item Compared to another DQN that needs 2000 episodes for similar performance.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Measurement}
        The number of episodes required for the average reward over a fixed number of previous episodes to stabilize indicates convergence speed.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Illustration}
        A graph showing average rewards over episodes will show a plateau indicating convergence.

    \frametitle{Challenges and Limitations of Deep Q-Networks (DQN)}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been a revolutionary step in reinforcement learning, but they face several challenges. Understanding these limitations is essential for effective implementation and optimization.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Challenges - Part 1}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Scalability}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item DQNs can struggle to perform efficiently as the complexity of the environment increases (e.g., larger state and action spaces).
                \item \textbf{Example}: In gaming, as the game environment expands or increases in difficulty, the size of the Q-table increases, making it impractical to compute and update values for every possible state-action pair.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Stability and Convergence}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item DQNs can suffer from instability during training, leading to oscillations and performance degradation.
                \item \textbf{Key Points}:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Non-stationary Targets}: The target updates in DQNs depend on current Q-values, which change due to the learning process itself.
                        \item \textbf{Example}: If a DQN updates its estimates frequently using the latest data but the model has not yet stabilized, it can become erratic.
                    \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Overestimation Bias}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item DQNs can overestimate the Q-values due to maximization bias, leading to suboptimal policies.
                \item \textbf{Example}: Selecting actions based on the maximum predicted Q-value can favor certain actions that may not be optimal. This can be mitigated using techniques like Double Q-Learning.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Experience Replay}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item By storing experience tuples (state, action, reward, next state) and sampling from them, DQNs can break the correlation between consecutive experiences, enhancing stability.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Target Networks}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Using a separate, slowly updated target network for calculating target Q-values helps maintain consistent target values over multiple updates, thus addressing stability issues.
            \end{itemize}
