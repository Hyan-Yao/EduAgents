Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

### Learning Objectives for "Foundations of Machine Learning" Course

1. **Core Concepts of Machine Learning:**
   - Students will be able to define machine learning, differentiate between its various types (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning), and apply these concepts in practical scenarios.

2. **Mathematical Foundations:**
   - Students will demonstrate proficiency in the mathematical principles underpinning machine learning (linear algebra, statistics, probability) and integrate these principles when developing and implementing algorithms.

3. **Programming Proficiency:**
   - Students will acquire basic to intermediate programming skills in languages and tools commonly used in machine learning (e.g., Python, R, MATLAB) and will be able to implement machine learning algorithms using libraries and frameworks (TensorFlow, scikit-learn, PyTorch) in practical projects.

4. **Practical Application and Problem Solving:**
   - Students will learn to formulate machine learning problems, select appropriate algorithms, evaluate performance on real-world datasets, and apply critical thinking for iterative problem-solving and solution refinement.

5. **Ethical Considerations in Machine Learning:**
   - Students will discuss the ethical implications of machine learning, including issues related to bias, fairness, transparency, and accountability, and propose strategies for ethical practices in AI system development.

6. **Industry Standards and Collaboration:**
   - Students will collaborate effectively in teams to simulate professional environments, creating and presenting a final project that reflects industry standards in machine learning applications, while communicating complex technical information to both expert and non-expert audiences.
