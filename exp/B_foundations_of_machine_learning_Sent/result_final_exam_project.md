# Final Project Plan Document

### Project Title: Real-World Machine Learning Challenge

---

## Project Description
Students will collaborate in teams to identify a real-world problem that can be addressed with machine learning solutions. This project will focus on applying course concepts while emphasizing ethical considerations and effective communication of results. It simulates a professional ML industry environment.

---

## Objectives
1. Collaborate effectively in teams to tackle a real-world problem using machine learning.
2. Apply learned theoretical concepts to practical scenarios.
3. Analyze datasets and select appropriate machine learning methodologies.
4. Communicate findings clearly both through written reports and presentations.
5. Consider and discuss ethical implications related to the selected problem and solution.
