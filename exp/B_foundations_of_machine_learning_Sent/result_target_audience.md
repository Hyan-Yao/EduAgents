Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

### 1) Target Student Profile

**Typical Background:**
- Educational Level: Undergraduate or graduate students majoring in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, Statistics, or related fields; potential engineering backgrounds.
- Prior Experience: Basic exposure to programming and statistics; lack of in-depth knowledge in machine learning concepts and applications.

**Prerequisite Knowledge:**
- Mathematics: Foundational knowledge in linear algebra, calculus, and basic statistics; may struggle with practical applications of these concepts in machine learning.
- Programming Skills: Basic proficiency in programming languages (Python, R, MATLAB); may not possess advanced skills for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- Understanding of Algorithms: General comprehension of algorithms and data structures is beneficial, but not formally required.

**Career Aspirations:**
- Pursuing roles in data analysis, artificial intelligence, software development, research, and academia; interests may range from practical application to theoretical research in machine learning, data science, and AI.

**Potential Knowledge Gaps:**
- Mathematical Concepts: Difficulty connecting theoretical mathematics to practical machine learning applications.
- Programming Experience: Limited familiarity with advanced libraries and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Understanding of Machine Learning Frameworks: Lack of experience with collaborative coding tools (Git/GitHub).
- Ethical Considerations: Insufficient understanding of the ethical implications and responsibilities associated with AI and machine learning.
- Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking: Rigid problem-solving techniques; need for development of critical thinking skills for real-world applications.

**Learning Needs:**
- Supplemental instruction in prerequisites, such as refresher workshops on mathematics and programming.
- Hands-on programming practice with real-world datasets to enhance learning.
- Exposure to collaborative environments through team projects that use version control and communication tools.
- Ethical framework development through discussions and case studies on the implications in machine learning.
- Regular assessments and feedback opportunities to monitor progress and support varying levels of prior knowledge.
