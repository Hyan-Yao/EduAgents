\frametitle{Data Collection and Preparation - Dataset Selection and Visualization}
    Choosing the right dataset is imperative for successful outcomes.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Considerations:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Size of the Dataset:} Ensure it's large enough to capture variability but not too large to create computational challenges.
            \item \textbf{Quality of Data:} Clean and well-structured data leads to better model performance.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Example:} In a health-related project, clean and structured patient data is more reliable than a vast unverified dataset.

    \textbf{Key Takeaways:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data quality is just as important as quantity for reliable outcomes.
        \item Preprocessing enhances data quality for analysis.
        \item Feature selection impacts model accuracy.
    \end{itemize}
