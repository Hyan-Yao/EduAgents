\frametitle{Implementing Decision Trees - Key Points & Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Visualization helps in understanding decision-making processes.
            \item Adjust hyperparameters like \texttt{max\_depth} and \texttt{criterion} for better performance.
            \item Understanding impurity measures (Gini, entropy) is crucial for splits.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Summary}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Steps include loading data, splitting, fitting the model, and evaluation.
            \item Tools like \texttt{sklearn} make the process accessible for all skill levels.
        \end{itemize}
