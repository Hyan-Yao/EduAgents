    \frametitle{Introduction to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) involves multiple autonomous agents that learn to make decisions through interaction with their environment and each other. Each agent aims to maximize its own reward, leading to complex dynamics where agents must collaborate, compete, or negotiate.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Characteristics}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Multiple Agents:} Operate in the same environment and make decisions based on observations.
            \item \textbf{Decentralized Learning:} Agents learn independently, affecting each other's policies.
            \item \textbf{Dynamic Environment:} Continuous adaptation occurs as agents change strategies in response to others.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Key Concepts in Multi-Agent Systems - Overview}
    Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) involve multiple agents interacting within an environment. Understanding the following key concepts is crucial for anyone studying Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agents
        \item Environment
        \item States
        \item Actions
        \item Rewards

    \frametitle{Key Concepts in Multi-Agent Systems - Agents and Environment}
    \begin{block}{1. Agents}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} An agent is an entity capable of perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment via actuators.
            \item \textbf{Example:} In a soccer simulation, each player acts as an agent, making decisions to maximize their team's chance of winning.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{2. Environment}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} The environment includes everything that an agent interacts with and operates in. It defines the context in which agents function.
            \item \textbf{Example:} In the soccer simulation, this includes the field, the position of players, the ball, and the rules of the game.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts in Multi-Agent Systems - States, Actions, Rewards, Policies}
    \begin{block}{3. States}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} A state represents the current situation of the environment as perceived by an agent.
            \item \textbf{Example:} A state in the soccer game could represent the positions of all players, the score, and the time left.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{4. Actions}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} Actions are choices made by agents in response to the perceived state of their environment.
            \item \textbf{Example:} Actions can include "pass," "dribble," "shoot," or "defend."
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{5. Rewards}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} Rewards are signals received by agents after performing actions, reflecting the quality of those actions.
            \item \textbf{Example:} A player may receive a reward of +1 for a goal or a penalty for a red card.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{6. Policies}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} A policy is a strategy that an agent employs to determine its actions based on the current state.
            \item \textbf{Example:} A policy might define that a player will pass if a teammate is close or shoot if within the penalty box.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item MAS consist of multiple agents interacting with both the environment and each other.
        \item States, actions, and rewards definitions vary based on agent interactions and environmental complexity.
        \item Understanding how agents learn and adapt policies is crucial for effective MARL strategies.

    \begin{block}{Overview of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)}
        Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) involves multiple agents that learn simultaneously in a shared environment.
        Each agent has its own goals but can interact with and influence the other agents. This introduces challenges like:
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Multi-Agent Q-learning}
        Multi-Agent Q-learning extends the classic Q-learning algorithm to environments with multiple agents. Each agent maintains its own Q-value function to evaluate action choices.
