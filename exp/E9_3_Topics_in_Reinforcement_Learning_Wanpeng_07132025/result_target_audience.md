### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

**Recommendations for Course Design Adjustments:**

1. **Assess Student Readiness:**
   - Implement preliminary assessments to gauge student preparedness, allowing for tailored content delivery.

2. **Enhance Introductory Sessions:**
   - Include additional foundational sessions that clearly outline key reinforcement learning concepts and their differences from other paradigms.

3. **Implement Practical Programming Workshops:**
   - Offer hands-on programming labs focusing on algorithm implementation, with specific reinforcement learning libraries to facilitate learning.

4. **Develop Research Skills:**
   - Introduce workshops focused on critical thinking, academic writing, and structuring literature reviews to build confidence among students with little research experience.

5. **Facilitate Ethical Discussions:**
   - Integrate ethics into the curriculum, potentially through guest speakers or real-world case studies that encourage critical engagement.

6. **Refine Learning Materials:**
   - Collaborate with instructional designers to produce clear, structured, and concise course materials, including a well-defined reading list and instructional slides.

7. **Incorporate Guest Lectures:**
   - Include insights from industry experts to enhance the real-world relevance of course content and inspire student engagement.

8. **Implement Structured Feedback Mechanisms:**
   - Set up periodic feedback opportunities, such as mid-course surveys, to continuously evaluate student satisfaction and course effectiveness.
