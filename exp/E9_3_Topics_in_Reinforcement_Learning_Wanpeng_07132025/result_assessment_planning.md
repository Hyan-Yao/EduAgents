Assessment & Evaluation Planning
================================

# Assessment and Evaluation Plan for "Topics in Reinforcement Learning"

## Overview
This document outlines the structured assessment strategy for the "Topics in Reinforcement Learning" course with an emphasis on real-world applications, project-based evaluations, and milestone-driven learning.

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand fundamental reinforcement learning concepts.
2. Develop, implement, and evaluate RL algorithms.
3. Investigate and apply advanced RL techniques in real-world problems.
4. Conduct critical research within the field of reinforcement learning.
5. Discuss ethical implications of RL technologies and propose responsible solutions.

## Assessment Components

### 1. Homework Assignments (30%)
- **Format**: Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)
- **Submission**: Via Canvas LMS
- **Frequency**: 5 assignments throughout the semester
- **Due Dates**: Every three weeks, starting Week 3
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Functionality (50 points)
  - Code Quality (30 points)
  - Documentation (20 points)

### 2. Midterm Presentation (20%)
- **Format**: Oral presentation with slides (.pdf)
- **Timing**: Week 8
- **Goal**: Present findings from a literature review on a chosen topic in reinforcement learning
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Content Knowledge (40 points)
  - Presentation Skills (30 points)
  - Q&A Handling (30 points)

### 3. Peer Feedback (10%)
- **Description**: Provide structured feedback on a peer’s midterm presentation and project
- **Submission**: Feedback forms via Canvas
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Constructiveness (50 points)
  - Timeliness (25 points)
  - Engagement (25 points)

### 4. Final Project (30%)
- **Format**: Comprehensive project report and presentation (.pdf, .ipynb)
- **Timeline**: Starts Week 9, due Week 15
- **Goal**: Tackle a real-world problem using RL solutions
- **Milestones**:
  - Project Proposal (Due Week 10)
  - Progress Report (Due Week 12)
- **Grading Rubric (30% report, 20% presentation)**:
  - Research Depth (40 points)
  - Implementation (30 points)
  - Analysis and Discussion (30 points)
  - Presentation Skills (20 points)

## Submission Logistics
- All assessments via **Canvas LMS**. Titles must include student's name and version (e.g., "Firstname_Lastname_Homework1").
- Late submissions incur a penalty of 10% per day unless arrangements are made.

## Continuous Feedback Mechanism
- **Mid-Course Surveys**: Conducted around Week 7.
- **Office Hours**: Weekly for direct student feedback and guidance.

## Academic Integrity Policy
Adherence to academic integrity is mandatory. Instances of cheating or plagiarism will not be tolerated.

## Accessibility
Students requiring accommodations should contact the university’s Accessibility Office for support.

## Conclusion
This assessment plan emphasizes practical skills and ethical considerations in reinforcement learning, enhancing student preparedness for roles in AI and machine learning.
