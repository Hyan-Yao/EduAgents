# Final Project Plan: Real-World Reinforcement Learning Applications

## Project Overview
The project requires students to collaboratively apply reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to address a real-world problem. This aligns with course objectives, promoting critical thinking, practical skills, and ethical considerations in RL technologies.

## Learning Objectives
1. **Fundamentals of RL**: Articulate concepts such as agents, environments, and policies.
2. **Algorithm Development**: Implement RL algorithms like Q-learning or actor-critic methods.
3. **Advanced Applications**: Apply deep reinforcement learning in a selected domain.
4. **Research Competency**: Conduct a literature review on current advancements or ethical implications in RL.
5. **Ethical Analysis**: Assess the societal impacts of RL applications and propose solutions.

## Timeline with Milestones
- **Milestone 1: Project Proposal**
  - **Due**: Week 10
  - **Format**: Written proposal (.pdf)
  - **Contents**: Identify the real-world problem, justify use of RL, outline goals and methodology.
  
- **Milestone 2: Progress Report**
  - **Due**: Week 12
  - **Format**: Update presentation (.pdf or .ipynb)
  - **Contents**: Algorithm implementation overview, preliminary results analysis, feedback summary.

- **Milestone 3: Final Deliverable**
  - **Due**: Week 15
  - **Format**: Comprehensive project report, including code (.ipynb) and presentation (.pdf)
