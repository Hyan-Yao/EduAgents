\begin{frame}[fragile]{Understanding Reinforcement Learning - Introduction}
    \frametitle{What is Reinforcement Learning (RL)?}
    Reinforcement Learning is a subset of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment** to achieve a goal. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The agent takes actions that affect the state of the environment.
        \item It receives **rewards** based on those actions.
        \item The objective is to maximize cumulative reward over time.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Key Components of Reinforcement Learning}
    \frametitle{Key Components}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item **Agent**: The learner or decision maker.
        \item **Environment**: The external system the agent interacts with.
        \item **States**: All possible situations the agent can find itself in.
        \item **Actions**: Choices available to the agent to influence the environment.
        \item **Rewards**: Feedback from the environment based on actions.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \begin{block}{Examples}
        \item Agent: A robotic vacuum.
        \item Environment: The room it operates in.
        \item States: Various positions on the floor.
        \item Actions: Moving forward, turning left, returning to charging station.
        \item Rewards: Points for cleaning, penalties for hitting obstacles.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{How Reinforcement Learning Works}
    \frametitle{Learning Process}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The agent begins untrained and explores the environment.
        \item Through **trial and error**, it learns which actions yield the best rewards.
        \item The agent develops a **policy**—a strategy that defines the best action for each state.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Comparison with Other Machine Learning Paradigms}
    \frametitle{ML Paradigms Comparison}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data Bias:} Influences from prejudiced training data may lead to unfair decisions by the RL agent.
        \item \textbf{Reward Bias:} Unbalanced reward signals may drive agents to learn harmful behaviors.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{example}
        An RL recommendation system trained predominantly on young adults' interactions may disregard older demographics, exacerbating social divides.
    \end{example}
\end{frame}

    \end{itemize}
    \begin{example}
        In autonomous vehicles, non-transparent decision-making can create safety risks.
    \end{example}
    
    \begin{block}{Accountability of RL Systems}
        Accountability defines who is responsible for RL agents' actions and consequences.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Determining responsibility is complex as RL agents gain autonomy.
        \item It is essential to verify compliance with ethical and legal standards.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{example}
        In healthcare, flawed RL algorithms may prioritize certain treatments, raising accountability questions among developers and providers.

    \begin{equation}
        R(s, a) = w_1 \cdot R_p + w_2 \cdot R_o
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( R(s, a) \): Total reward for a state-action pair
        \item \( R_p \): Reward based on passenger safety metrics
        \item \( R_o \): Reward based on overall ethical considerations (minimization of casualties)
        \item \( w_1, w_2 \): Weights reflecting societal ethical priorities

    \begin{block}{Key Ethical Considerations in Reinforcement Learning (RL)}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) poses unique ethical challenges that mirror human decision-making processes. The following are critical considerations:
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Bias and Fairness}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item RL algorithms can inherit biases present in training data, leading to unfair treatment of certain groups.
            \item Example: An RL model in hiring might favor candidates from specific backgrounds due to historical biases in the data.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Transparency and Explainability}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Many RL models, especially deep learning ones, are "black boxes," complicating trust and understanding.
            \item Example: In healthcare, clinicians must understand RL-based treatment recommendations to ensure patient safety.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

        \item \textbf{Accountability}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It is difficult to ascertain responsibility when RL systems err or cause harm.
            \item Example: In the case of an RL-driven autonomous vehicle accident, legal and ethical accountability is complicated.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Long-term Consequences}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item RL aims to maximize cumulative rewards, which might result in adverse long-term effects.
            \item Example: An RL algorithm focused on energy reduction could undermine grid stability if it prioritizes short-term savings.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Intervention and Control}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The degree of human oversight necessary for ethical RL deployment is vital as autonomy increases.
            \item Example: RL in military applications raises complex ethical issues about autonomous decision-making.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Mitigating Bias}: Improve methods to audit and refine training datasets to enhance fairness.
            \item \textbf{Enhancing Explainability}: Investigate techniques that simplify RL decision processes for better user understanding.
            \item \textbf{Establishing Ethical Frameworks}: Develop comprehensive guidelines for accountability in RL technologies.
            \item \textbf{Impact Assessment Studies}: Perform longitudinal studies to assess the societal implications of RL, especially in sensitive areas like healthcare.
            \item \textbf{Dynamic Intervention Strategies}: Create metrics to determine when human intervention is necessary in RL decision-making.
