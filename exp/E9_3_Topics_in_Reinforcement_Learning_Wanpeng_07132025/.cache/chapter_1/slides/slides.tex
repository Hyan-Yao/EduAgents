    \frametitle{Introduction to Reinforcement Learning - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning wherein an agent learns to make decisions by:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Taking actions in an environment
            \item Maximizing a cumulative reward
        \end{itemize}
        Unlike supervised learning, RL focuses on learning through interaction and feedback from the environment.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        Combines deep learning with reinforcement learning techniques to handle high-dimensional state spaces. Neural networks serve as function approximators for value functions or policies.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        AlphaGo uses DRL to play the game of Go at a superhuman level, predicting the best moves based on board states.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Handles complex input data (images, raw sensor data).
        \item Learns directly from high-dimensional sensory input without manual feature extraction.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{2. Policy Gradients}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        Directly optimizes the policy by maximizing the expected reward, adjusting the parameters of the policy using gradients instead of value functions.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Formula}
        The policy gradient theorem is expressed as:
        \begin{equation}
            \nabla J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} \left[ \nabla \log \pi_\theta(a|s) Q(s, a) \right]
        \end{equation}
        Where \( J(\theta) \) is the objective function, \( \pi_\theta(a|s) \) is the policy, and \( Q(s, a) \) is the action-value function.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        The REINFORCE algorithm uses this method to update the policy weights based on received rewards.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Suitable for high-dimensional action spaces.

    \begin{block}{Concept}
        Combines value-based and policy-based methods:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item **Actor**: Updates the policy (what action to take).
            \item **Critic**: Evaluates the action by estimating the value function (how good that action is).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
