    \begin{block}{Robustness and Generalization}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Adversarial Robustness:} Create agents that perform reliably in adversarial settings.
            \item \textbf{Generalization Across Environments:} Research on task-agnostic feature representation.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Human-AI Collaboration}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Interactive Learning:} Algorithms that efficiently adapt to human feedback (e.g., healthcare applications).
            \item \textbf{Trust and Explainability:} Developing interpretable RL systems to increase user confidence.
        \end{itemize}
