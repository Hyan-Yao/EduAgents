\frametitle{Rewards - Details}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        In reinforcement learning (RL), a reward is a scalar feedback signal received by an agent after it takes an action in a given state.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Purpose}: Guides the agent in learning which actions yield positive outcomes.
        \item \textbf{Objective}: Maximize cumulative reward over time.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Types of Rewards}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Immediate Reward}: Received after taking an action (denoted as \( r_t \)).
            \item \textbf{Cumulative Reward}: Total reward over series of actions given by
            \begin{equation}
                G_t = r_t + \gamma r_{t+1} + \gamma^2 r_{t+2} + \ldots
            \end{equation}
            where \( \gamma \) (0 â‰¤ \( \gamma \) < 1) is the discount factor.
        \end{itemize}
