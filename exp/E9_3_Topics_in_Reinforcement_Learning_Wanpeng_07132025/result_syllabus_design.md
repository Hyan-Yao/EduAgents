## Course Description
This course provides an in-depth exploration of reinforcement learning, covering fundamental concepts, algorithm development, advanced techniques, and ethical considerations. Students will engage in hands-on programming assignments, literature reviews, and critical discussions to prepare them for real-world applications and research in reinforcement learning.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this course, students will be able to:
1. **Define and Differentiate** key terms related to reinforcement learning and its distinction from other machine learning paradigms.
2. **Implement** basic reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA) and evaluate their performance.
3. **Explore and Apply** advanced reinforcement learning methods, including deep reinforcement learning and policy gradients, to practical scenarios.
4. **Conduct Research** by reviewing and critiquing current literature, identifying research gaps, and proposing innovative solutions.
5. **Identify Ethical Considerations** related to reinforcement learning technologies and their societal implications.
