    \begin{block}{Key Components of Spark Architecture}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Driver Program:} The main function that runs the user's code, creating SparkContext to coordinate tasks.
            \item \textbf{Cluster Manager:} Manages resources within the cluster (options: Apache Mesos, Hadoop YARN, Spark's standalone manager).
            \item \textbf{Worker Nodes:} Machines executing tasks; each runs executors that perform data processing and storage.
            \item \textbf{Tasks:} Smallest unit of work in Spark, executed by worker nodes in parallel.
        \end{itemize}
