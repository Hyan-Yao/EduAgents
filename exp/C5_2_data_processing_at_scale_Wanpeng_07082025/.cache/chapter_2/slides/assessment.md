### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** Which of the following is a predicted trend in distributed data processing?

  A) Increased reliance on single computing entities.
  B) Enhanced use of AI for data processing.
  C) Abandonment of cloud technologies.
  D) Reduction of data privacy measures.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** AI and machine learning are expected to play a significant role in optimizing data processing in the near future.

**Question 2:** What is a major advantage of adopting serverless computing?

  A) Higher upfront infrastructure costs.
  B) Manual scaling of servers.
  C) Automatic scaling and reduced operational costs.
  D) Decreased deployment speed.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Serverless computing offers automatic scaling and lowers operational costs by allowing developers to focus on their code.

**Question 3:** How does edge computing enhance data processing?

  A) By centralizing data processing.
  B) By increasing latency.
  C) By processing data closer to the source.
  D) By eliminating the need for IoT devices.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Edge computing reduces latency by processing data nearer to where it is generated, improving performance in real-time applications.

**Question 4:** What benefit does a multi-cloud strategy provide organizations?

  A) Increased vendor lock-in.
  B) Decreased flexibility in resource allocation.
  C) Improved resilience against outages.
  D) Higher costs associated with data hosting.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Multi-cloud strategies allow organizations to leverage multiple vendors, improving resilience and reducing the risk of service outages.
