Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: "Data Processing at Scale"

## 1. Faculty Expertise Requirements
### Subject Matter Expertise:
- Advanced knowledge in:
  - Data models (Relational and NoSQL)
  - Distributed systems (Hadoop, Apache Spark)
  - Cloud computing architectures
  - Data pipeline management
  - Industry-standard tools (AWS, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, NoSQL)
  - Ethical implications in data practices

### Teaching Experience:
- Prior experience teaching in a hybrid format.
- Skills to engage students in both in-person and online environments.

### Continued Professional Development:
- Pathways for faculty to engage in ongoing training in emerging technologies (e.g., AI and LLMs) to keep course content relevant.

### Co-Instructors and Guest Lecturers:
- Potential to invite experts to fill gaps in knowledge areas (e.g., NoSQL databases).

## 2. Necessary Computing Resources
### Hardware Requirements:
- High-performance computers or access to cloud computing resources (e.g., AWS instances) for handling large datasets and running simulations.

### Software Requirements:
- Essential software:
  - Distributed Computing Frameworks (Hadoop, Apache Spark)
  - Database Management Systems (PostgreSQL, NoSQL solutions)
  - Project Management Tools (GitHub)
  - Cloud Services Management Tools (AWS, Kubernetes)

### Licensing:
- Ensure proper licensing for all software for educational use.

### Cloud Resource Accessibility:
- Potential partnerships with cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud) for educational credits or discounts.

### Virtual Labs:
- Plan for virtual lab environments for hands-on activities without requiring high-performance local machines.

## 3. Scheduling Constraints
### Class Structure:
- 75-minute hybrid sessions that require nuanced planning for student engagement.

### Coordination with TAs:
- TA schedules should align with class timings for grading and support.

### Flexibility for Recordings:
- Record all sessions for student review and flexibility.

### Office Hours Coordination:
- Well-structured office hours from TAs accommodating diverse student schedules.

## 4. Facility Limitations
### Classroom Infrastructure:
- AV technology for hybrid learning readiness.
- Reliable internet connection for student access to online tools.

### Testing Facility Technology:
- Pre-course technology checks for AV systems to prevent disruptions.

### Alternative Online Participation:
- Systems for online participation in hybrid classes to support those unable to attend in person.

## 5. Instructional Delivery Context
### Delivery Tools:
- Use of Canvas for course management (content, grading, submissions).

### Engagement Strategies:
- Tools for group collaboration (breakout rooms, Miro, Jamboard) to promote active engagement.

### Assessment Techniques:
- Incorporate peer evaluations in grading systems.

### Content Compliance:
- Ensure adherence to ASU's policies on accessibility, academic integrity, and copyright.

## 6. Additional Constraints
### TA Support:
- Multiple TAs available with familiarity in cloud and distributed tools for effective support.

### Pacing and Assessment:
- Maintain course pacing with structured deliverables and timely feedback.

### Regular Feedback Mechanisms:
- Establish a system for continuous student feedback on course experience for iterative improvements.

### Diversity and Inclusion:
- Ensure instructional materials reflect diverse perspectives on data science, particularly in ethical discussions.

### Summary
Successful delivery of the course "Data Processing at Scale" relies on a combination of skilled faculty expertise, robust computing resources, effective scheduling, and suitable facilities. Attention to instructional delivery methods and adherence to institutional policies are crucial. Ongoing evaluation of course effectiveness and adaptation to student needs will enhance learning outcomes.
