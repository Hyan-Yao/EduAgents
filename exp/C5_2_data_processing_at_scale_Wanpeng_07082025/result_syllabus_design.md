## Course Details
- **Course Code**: CS 515
- **Instructor**: [Your Name]
- **Email**: [Your Email]
- **Office Hours**: [Days/Times]
- **Course Duration**: 16 Weeks
- **Format**: Hybrid (In-Person and Online)

## Course Description
This course provides an in-depth understanding of data processing at scale, focusing on various data models, optimization techniques, and distributed database architectures. Through a combination of lectures, hands-on labs, and collaborative projects, students will explore industry-standard tools and develop the skills needed to manage large-scale data processing solutions in cloud environments.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Differentiate and evaluate data models such as relational, NoSQL, and graph databases.
2. Execute and optimize scalable query processing in distributed systems using technologies like Hadoop and Apache Spark.
3. Design distributed database architectures and deploy them in cloud environments with a focus on scalability and performance.
4. Develop data pipelines and support infrastructure for cloud computing and large language models (LLMs).
5. Demonstrate proficiency in industry-standard tools such as AWS, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and various NoSQL databases.
6. Collaborate effectively in teams to develop scalable data processing solutions.
7. Apply critical thinking to troubleshoot and optimize data-related systems.
8. Analyze ethical implications concerning data privacy and integrity within data processing environments.
