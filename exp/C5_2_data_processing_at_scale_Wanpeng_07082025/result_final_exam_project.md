Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan

## Project Title: 
**Building a Scalable Data Processing Solution for a Smart City Initiative**

## Project Overview
In this final project, students will collaboratively design and implement a scalable data processing solution suitable for a fictional smart city initiative. Teams will be responsible for choosing a specific aspect of smart city data (e.g., traffic management, energy consumption, public safety), selecting appropriate data models, developing a data pipeline, and deploying their solutions using cloud resources. This project aims to emphasize critical thinking, teamwork, and the hands-on application of distributed systems and data processing techniques.

## Project Objectives
1. Collaboratively design a scalable data processing solution for a smart city aspect.
2. Utilize real-world data and tools to deliver a functional data pipeline.
3. Apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills to overcome project challenges.
4. Foster teamwork and communication among team members.
