Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

### 1) Comprehensive Profile of Target Students

**Demographics:**
- Total Enrollment: ~135 graduate students
- International/Domestic Ratio: 60% international, 40% domestic
- Academic Background: Predominantly from Computer Science; some from Electrical and Industrial Engineering

**Prior Knowledge:**
- Strong programming skills in Python, C++, and Java
- Varying exposure to distributed systems, cloud data platforms, and parallel computing frameworks
- Inconsistent familiarity with tools like Hadoop, Spark, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Kubernetes, and AWS
- Limited understanding of foundational concepts in discrete mathematics and systems optimization

**Learning Needs:**
- Additional training on distributed systems and cloud infrastructure
- Clarification on complex concepts for non-native English speakers
- Slower pacing and differentiated instruction to cater to varying levels of comfort with technical terminology
- Preference for project-based assessments and practical learning environments

**Preferred Learning Modalities:**
- Project-based assessments
- Collaborative learning opportunities
- Supportive resources, including workshops and supplemental materials

### 2) Data-driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Diverse Instructional Techniques:**
   - Implement blended learning methods combining in-person and online platforms to increase engagement.
   - Use breakout rooms and collaboration tools like Miro and Jamboard for interactive problem-solving.

2. **Supplemental Resources:**
   - Offer workshops on foundational topics such as distributed systems and cloud architecture.
   - Create an online resource repository with supplemental materials and recorded lectures.

3. **Ongoing Assessment and Feedback:**
   - Conduct regular feedback mechanisms (e.g., surveys) to adapt pacing and instructional content.
   - Use low-stakes assessments to gauge understanding and provide timely help.

4. **Peer Support and Collaboration:**
   - Promote group projects that pair students with diverse skills for peer learning opportunities.
   - Establish peer study groups or mentorship programs for additional academic support.

5. **Instructor and TA Availability:**
   - Ensure TAs are knowledgeable in the tools used in the course for out-of-class assistance.
   - Increase office hours or Q&A sessions for student support.

6. **Flexibility in Learning Pathways:**
   - Conduct pre-course assessments to tailor instruction based on individual readiness.
   - Offer accelerated paths for advanced students while providing additional support for others.

7. **Language Support Systems:**
   - Provide glossaries of key terms upon course onset to ease understanding for non-native speakers.

8. **Guest Lectures and Industry Engagement:**
   - Incorporate guest speakers from the industry to bridge course content and real-world applications, particularly focused on ethical data practices.

9. **Project Variety:**
   - Diversify projects in complexity and technology usage to appeal to various student interests and skill sets.

10. **Regular Self-Reflection and Feedback Evaluation:**
    - Encourage self-reflective practices post-assignments to support personal growth and learning articulation, complemented by structured peer feedback discussions.
