## Faculty Expertise Requirements
1. **Subject Matter Experts:**
   - Strong background in data processing using tools such as Apache Spark and Hadoop.
   - Experience in theoretical concepts and practical implementations in data analytics.

2. **Pedagogical Skills:**
   - Expertise in teaching complex topics with the ability to present real-world case studies.
   - Experience in project-based learning and effective presentation skills.

3. **Technical Proficiency:**
   - Proficiency in programming languages relevant to data processing (e.g., Python, Scala).
   - Experience with big data technologies and associated tools.

## Necessary Computing Resources
1. **Hardware Requirements:**
   - Access to high-performance computing resources, including cluster systems or cloud computing services.

2. **Lab Facilities:**
   - Dedicated lab facilities equipped with high-efficiency data processing computers.
   - Adequate number of machines to meet expected class sizes.

3. **Internet Access:**
   - Reliable and high-speed internet to facilitate access to external datasets and cloud-based tools.

## Software Requirements
1. **Data Processing Frameworks:**
   - Access to data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark and Hadoop, with necessary licenses for proprietary software or guidance on open-source alternatives.

2. **Programming Languages and Libraries:**
   - Support for programming environments in Python and Scala, including pre-installed libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy) for data manipulation.

3. **Presentation Software:**
   - Availability of tools for project presentations (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides) to assist students in creating and delivering final presentations.

## Scheduling Constraints
1. **Course Timing:**
   - Classes should be scheduled considering the availability of faculty and lab resources; must avoid high-demand timings.

2. **Laboratory Sessions:**
   - Scheduling should accommodate available facility hours and take variable lab sizes into account based on class capacity.

3. **TA Support Availability:**
   - Synchronization of TA support to align with course schedule to ensure adequate student assistance during hands-on sessions.

## Facility Limitations
1. **Classroom Space:**
   - Classrooms must have adequate technology support (projectors, screens) for lectures and student presentations.

2. **Capacity Constraints:**
   - Facilities need to accommodate the maximum expected number of students, ensuring adequate seating and computer resources.

3. **Compliance with Policies:**
   - Aligning with institutional policies regarding space usage, scheduling, and agreements with external vendors for software and tools.

## Additional Considerations
1. **Syllabus Coverage and Accessibility:**
   - Address feedback on syllabus adequacy, enhancing coverage, accessibility, and policy clarity.

2. **Coherence and Alignment:**
   - Strengthening the coherence of course material and better alignment of learning objectives with course structure.

3. **Continuous Feedback Loops:**
   - Implement mechanisms for ongoing feedback from students and faculty to refine course content and instructional methods over time.

## Conclusion
The successful delivery of the "C6_3_data_processing_at_scale" course requires concerted efforts in ensuring faculty expertise, robust technology infrastructure, strategic scheduling of resources, and continuous improvements based on stakeholder feedback.
