# Final Project Plan: Data Processing at Scale Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This capstone project replaces the traditional final exam and allows students to showcase their understanding and skills in data processing using real-world data and scenarios. The project aligns with course objectives by requiring students to identify, implement, evaluate, and communicate solutions to practical data processing challenges using frameworks like Apache Spark and Hadoop.

## Learning Objectives
- **Identify and Describe**: Define core data processing concepts and tools.
- **Implementation**: Implement data processing techniques using the chosen frameworks.
- **Evaluate**: Assess performance regarding processing speed, resource efficiency, and accuracy.
- **Solve Practical Problems**: Center on solving real-world data processing issues.
- **Communicate Effectively**: Present findings to technical and non-technical audiences.

   - **Content**: Explanation of techniques, results, visualizations, and insights.
   - **Assessment Criteria**: Technical execution, analytical depth, clarity, insights drawn.

4. **Cumulative Final Presentation (20%)**
   - **Due**: Week 14
   - **Format**: 15-minute group presentation using PowerPoint/Google Slides.
   - **Content**: Key findings and execution process.
   - **Assessment Criteria**: Communication effectiveness, clarity, visual aids usage, audience engagement.

5. **Peer Review Component (10%)**
   - **Due**: Following presentations in Week 14
   - **Format**: Peer evaluations based on a provided rubric.
   - **Content**: Constructive feedback on peer projects.
   - **Assessment Criteria**: Quality of feedback focusing on strengths and improvement areas.

### Project Format
- **Team vs. Individual Work**: Groups of 3-4 or individual projects.
- **Submission Format**: Deliverables submitted via Canvas LMS following the naming convention: **[Group/LastName_FirstInitial_AssignmentDate].pdf/.ipynb**.

### Assessment Rubrics
| **Milestone**                | **Exemplary (5)** | **Proficient (4)** | **Satisfactory (3)** | **Needs Improvement (2)** | **Unsatisfactory (1)** |
|------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Clarity & Relevance**      | Exceptionally clear and relevant. | Mostly clear, minor gaps. | Some clarity, lacks relevance. | Limited clarity and objectives. | No relevance demonstrated. |
| **Implementation Quality**   | Expert execution of techniques. | Good execution, few issues. | Basic execution with notable errors. | Several execution issues. | No execution evident. |
| **Depth of Analysis**        | Thorough analysis and insights. | Good analysis with insights. | Basic analysis, lacks depth. | Poor analysis lacks coherence. | No analysis evident. |
| **Presentation Skills**      | Engaging and clear presentation. | Mostly clear with engagement issues. | Adequate but confusing. | Limited engagement and clarity. | Incoherent presentation. |

### Continuous Feedback Mechanisms
- **Weekly Check-Ins**: Regular discussions to address project status and challenges.
- **Instructor & Peer Feedback**: Scheduled sessions for ongoing support.
- **Midterm Feedback**: Session to adjust expectations and address student concerns.

### Academic Integrity Considerations
All collaborations must adhere to academic integrity policies. Plagiarism is not tolerated, and all non-original work must be cited.

## Conclusion
This capstone project is designed to facilitate applied learning in data processing and foster collaboration and critical thinking. It aligns with industry standards and prepares students for future careers in data-intensive environments.
