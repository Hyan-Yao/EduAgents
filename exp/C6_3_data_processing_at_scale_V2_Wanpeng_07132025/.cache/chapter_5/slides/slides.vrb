\frametitle{Working with Datasets - Key Points & Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Datasets combine the best features of RDDs and DataFrames.
        \item Provide type safety and optimizations that improve performance.
        \item Ideal for scenarios requiring both functional transformations and structural queries.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Summary}
        Datasets in Spark enhance data processing capabilities by delivering advantages such as compile-time type safety and optimized execution. They enable a powerful programming paradigm for extensive data transformations and analysis.
