\frametitle{Types of Neural Networks - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        RNNs are made for sequences, ideal for time series and natural language processing.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Features:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Hidden State: Recalls previous inputs.
            \item Loops: Retains information over time.
            \item Variations (LSTM & GRU): Address vanishing gradients.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Applications:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Language modeling
            \item Sentiment analysis
            \item Time-series prediction
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example:} Processing a sentence word by word while updating context.
    \end{itemize}
