Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan for "D8_3 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence"

## Project Overview
This project will replace the traditional final exam. Students will collaboratively design an Artificial Intelligence solution to address a real-world problem, incorporating critical thinking, applied skills, and ethical considerations.

## Objectives
1. Apply AI concepts and technologies to a practical problem.
2. Implement an AI solution using Python or AI tools.
3. Analyze the ethical ramifications of the AI solution designed.
4. Evaluate and propose innovative solutions to complex issues with AI.
5. Effectively work in teams and present findings to a diverse audience.
6. Conduct research on current trends and ethical considerations in AI.
