    \frametitle{Significance in the Field of Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: RL involves training agents to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
        
        \item \textbf{Importance}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Real-World Applications}: Foundational in fields like robotics (robot navigation), gaming (AI opponents), finance (automated trading), and healthcare (treatment planning).

    \frametitle{Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Agents and Environments}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An \textit{agent} is the learner or decision-maker, while the \textit{environment} encompasses everything the agent interacts with.
            \item \textbf{Example}: In a game of chess, the player is the agent, and the chessboard is the environment.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{States and Rewards}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The \textit{state} represents the current situation of the agent in the environment.
            \item \textit{Rewards} are feedback signals indicating the success of the agent's actions.
            \item \textbf{Example}: In a maze, reaching the exit yields a positive reward while hitting a wall results in a negative reward.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Trial and Error Learning}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Emphasizes learning through exploration (trying new strategies) and exploitation (leveraging known strategies).
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Agents must balance exploring new actions with exploiting current knowledge to maximize performance.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Cumulative Reward}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Success in RL is measured through cumulative rewards over time, reinforcing behaviors leading to long-term success.
        \end{itemize}

        next_state, reward = self.environment.step(action)
        # Apply learning algorithm here
    \end{lstlisting}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Algorithm Implementations}
    \begin{block}{Overview of Key Algorithms}
        In this slide, we will explore four major reinforcement learning algorithms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Q-learning
            \item Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
            \item Policy Gradients
            \item Actor-Critic Methods
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Q-learning}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to learn the value of an action in a particular state.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{How it Works}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A **Q-table** is used to store values for each state-action pair.
            \item Updates Q-values using the Bellman equation:
            \begin{equation}
                Q(s, a) \gets Q(s, a) + \alpha [R + \gamma \max_a Q(s', a) - Q(s, a)]
            \end{equation}
            Where:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \( s \): current state
                \item \( a \): action taken
                \item \( R \): reward received
                \item \( s' \): next state
                \item \( \alpha \): learning rate
                \item \( \gamma \): discount factor
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        Consider a robot navigating a maze, receiving feedback through rewards upon reaching the exit.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Deep Q-Networks (DQN)}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        DQN combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle large state spaces.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{How it Works}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Uses a **neural network** to approximate Q-values instead of a Q-table.
            \item Implements **Experience Replay** for improved training efficiency.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Components}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Target Network}: Stabilizes learning by holding a fixed set of weights for Q-value estimates.
            \item \textbf{Experience Replay}: Storing past experiences and randomly sampling them to train the model.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        Playing video games like Atari, where the input is raw pixel data, and the model learns to play from that.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Policy Gradients and Actor-Critic Methods}
    \begin{block}{Policy Gradients}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Definition: Directly optimize the policy function $\pi(a|s;\theta)$.
            \item Key Formula:
            \begin{equation}
                \nabla J(\theta) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \nabla \log \pi(a|s;\theta) R \right]
            \end{equation}
            \item Example: Robot learns to balance a pole by directly adjusting actions based on observed angles.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Actor-Critic Methods}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Combines the advantages of value-based and policy-based methods.
            \item The **actor** suggests actions, and the **critic** evaluates these actions using a value function.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Features}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reduces update variance using value estimates.
            \item Actor is updated via the policy gradient; critic uses temporal difference learning.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        A self-driving car balancing exploration of new routes with exploitation of known safe paths.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Q-learning** is fundamental to understanding value functions.
        \item **DQN** effectively manages large state spaces using neural networks.
        \item **Policy gradients** focus on optimizing policies directly.
        \item **Actor-critic methods** enhance performance by blending elements from both paradigms.
    \end{itemize}
    
    This slide summarizes the essential reinforcement learning algorithms paving the way for understanding more complex systems and their future applications.

            \end{equation}
            Where \( R \) is the cumulative reward, and \( r_t \) is the reward at time \( t \).

            \item Rewards over one episode: 
                \([-1, -1, +10]\) 
            \item \textbf{Cumulative Reward Calculation:}

                R = -1 - 1 + 10 = 8
            \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Example for Convergence:}
        \begin{itemize}
