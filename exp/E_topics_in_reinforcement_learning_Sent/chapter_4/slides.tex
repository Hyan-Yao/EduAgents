    \frametitle{Introduction to Q-Learning}
    \begin{block}{What is Q-Learning?}
        Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of actions taken in various states within an environment.
        It enables an agent to make optimal decisions without requiring a model of the environment's dynamics, making it effective in stochastic scenarios.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Importance in Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Off-Policy Learning:} Can utilize experiences from different policies to improve decision-making.
        \item \textbf{Potential for Generalization:} It can generalize learning across states and actions for improved performance.
        \item \textbf{Combining Exploration and Exploitation:} Balances exploring new actions with exploiting known rewarding actions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Key Components of Q-Learning}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Agent:} The learner or decision-maker (e.g., robot, game character).
        \item \textbf{Environment:} The setting in which the agent operates (e.g., maze, game).
        \item \textbf{States (S):} All possible situations the agent can be in.
        \item \textbf{Actions (A):} Possible moves the agent can make in a state.
        \item \textbf{Rewards (R):} Feedback from the environment in response to actions.
        \item \textbf{Q-Value (Q):} Estimates the expected utility of taking an action in a given state.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Q-Learning Update Rule}
    The core of Q-learning is the Q-value update rule, defined mathematically as:

    \begin{equation}
        Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
    \end{equation}
    
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( Q(s, a) \) = Current Q-value for action \( a \) at state \( s \)
        \item \( \alpha \) = Learning rate (0 < \( \alpha \) ≤ 1)
        \item \( r \) = Reward received after moving to the next state
        \item \( \gamma \) = Discount factor (0 ≤ \( \gamma \) < 1)
        \item \( s' \) = New state after action \( a \) is taken
        \item \( a' \) = Possible next actions from the new state
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example Scenario}
    Imagine a robot navigating a grid to reach a target:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each square on the grid represents a state.
        \item The robot has four possible actions (up, down, left, right).
        \item Receives rewards (+10 for reaching the target, -1 for hitting a wall).
        \item Uses rewards to update its Q-values, improving its policy over time until it finds the most efficient path to the target.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Understanding Off-Policy Learning - Definition}
    \begin{block}{Definition of Off-Policy Learning}
        Off-policy learning is a type of reinforcement learning where the policy being improved is different from the policy used to generate the data. This means that an agent can learn from experiences that were not generated by its current behavior strategy.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Contrasts with \textbf{on-policy learning}: learns solely from actions taken by the current strategy.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Off-Policy Learning - Significance in Q-Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Flexibility}: Learn from a wider variety of experiences, including those from other agents or datasets.
        \item \textbf{Experience Replay}: Stores and reuses previous experiences to improve efficiency, breaking correlations between sequential experiences.
        \item \textbf{Separate Exploration and Exploitation}: Decouples exploration policy from the target policy, allowing for more effective learning strategies.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Off-Policy Learning - Example and Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Off-Policy: A robot learns navigation from another robot’s experiences.
                \item On-Policy: A robot learns only from its own real-time experiences.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Points to Emphasize}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Essential for effective Q-learning.
                \item Accelerates learning using experiences from other policies.
                \item Improves handling of temporal correlations through experience replay.

    \frametitle{Understanding Off-Policy Learning - Q-Values and Applications}
    \begin{block}{Mathematical Concept of Q-Values}
        In Q-learning, the Q-value is estimated using the equation:
        \begin{equation}
            Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
        \end{equation}
        where:

            \item $\alpha$: learning rate
            \item $r$: reward received
            \item $\gamma$: discount factor
            \item $s'$: new state
            \item $a'$: possible actions in the new state
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Applications and Use Cases}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Game playing (e.g., AlphaZero)
                \item Robotics: transferring learning across different environments.

    \frametitle{Key Concepts of Q-Learning - Introduction}
    Understanding the core elements of Q-learning is vital for grasping how reinforcement learning works. 
    Here, we break down the fundamental concepts that form the backbone of Q-learning:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agents
        \item States
        \item Actions
        \item Rewards
        \item Value Functions
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concept: Agents}
    An **agent** is an autonomous entity that makes decisions in an environment. 
    In the context of Q-learning, the agent learns how to achieve specific goals through trial and error.
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Imagine a robot (agent) exploring a maze. Its goal is to find the exit while collecting points.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concept: States and Actions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A **state** represents the current situation or configuration of the environment. 
        In Q-learning, states are defined to capture relevant information for decision-making.
        
        \begin{block}{Example}
            The robot's position could be a state, such as (x=3, y=5).
        \end{block}
        
        \item **Actions** are the choices available to the agent in any given state. 
        The agent selects an action based on its current knowledge.
        
        \begin{block}{Example}
            Actions could include "move left," "move right," "move up," or "move down."
        \end{block}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concept: Rewards and Value Functions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A **reward** is a feedback signal received after performing an action in a particular state.
        Rewards guide the agent towards desirable outcomes.
        
        \begin{block}{Example}
            Positive reward (+10) for moving closer to the exit; negative reward (-5) for hitting a wall.
        \end{block}
        
        \item **Value functions** estimate the expected return from a given state after certain actions.
        In Q-learning, we use the **Q-value**, representing the value of a state-action pair.
        
        \begin{equation}
        Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
        \end{equation} 
        Where: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $s$: current state
            \item $a$: action taken
            \item $r$: reward received
            \item $s'$: next state
            \item $\alpha$: learning rate (step size)
            \item $\gamma$: discount factor (future reward importance)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points and Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Interconnected Elements**: The interactions between agents, states, actions, rewards, and value functions drive the learning process.
        \item **Trial and Error**: The agent learns optimal behaviors by continually improving based on rewards.
        \item **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: The agent must balance exploring new actions and exploiting known actions that yield higher rewards.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Summary}
        Q-learning is a powerful tool in reinforcement learning. By understanding these key concepts, 
        you'll be better prepared to explore more advanced topics, such as the Q-learning algorithm itself, which will be covered next.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Agent**: Learner/decision-maker in the environment.
        \item **State (s)**: Current situation of the agent.
        \item **Action (a)**: Possible moves the agent can make.
        \item **Reward (r)**: Feedback after taking an action.
        \item **Q-value (Q(s,a))**: Value of taking action **a** in state **s**.

        Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( Q(s, a) \): Current Q-value for state \(s\) and action \(a\).
        \item \( r \): Reward received after taking action \(a\) in state \(s\).
        \item \( s' \): New state after action \(a\).
        \item \( \alpha \) (0 < \( \alpha \) ≤ 1): Learning rate.
        \item \( \gamma \) (0 ≤ \( \gamma \) < 1): Discount factor.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Update Rule Explanation}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Start with the current estimate of the Q-value \( Q(s, a) \).
            \item Calculate expected future rewards using the immediate reward \( r \) and the best Q-value in the next state across all actions.
            \item Combine current estimate and error, scaled by learning rate \( \alpha \).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Q-Learning Algorithm - Example and Key Points}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Consider a grid world where an agent can move in four directions (up, down, left, right). The agent learns optimal actions through rewards for reaching goals or penalties for obstacles.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Q-learning is off-policy, learning optimal policy values independently of agents' actions.
        \item Balancing exploration and exploitation is essential, often managed with strategies like \( \epsilon \)-greedy.
        \item Capable of handling stochastic environments by averaging multiple training episodes.

        \end{equation}
        Where:

    \frametitle{Code Implementation of Q-Learning}
    Here is a simple implementation of Q-learning in Python:
    \begin{lstlisting}
import numpy as np

    \frametitle{Exploring Hyperparameters in Q-learning}
    \begin{block}{Understanding Hyperparameters}
        Hyperparameters are crucial settings that influence the learning process of the agent in Q-learning. 
        Fine-tuning these can significantly impact learning efficiency and effectiveness.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Hyperparameters - Learning Rate}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Learning Rate ($\alpha$)}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} Determines how much the Q-value is updated during learning (ranges from 0 to 1).
            \item \textbf{Effect:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item High $\alpha$ (e.g., 0.9): Faster learning, potential instability.
                    \item Low $\alpha$ (e.g., 0.1): Slower learning, risk of being stuck in suboptimal policies.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Example Formula:}
            \begin{equation}
                Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + \alpha \times (R + \gamma \times \max_a Q(s', a) - Q(s, a))

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Discount Factor ($\gamma$)}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} Balances immediate and future rewards (ranges from 0 to 1).
            \item \textbf{Effect:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item High $\gamma$ (e.g., 0.9): Prioritizes future rewards, encourages long-term strategies.
                    \item Low $\gamma$ (e.g., 0.1): Focuses on immediate rewards, may lead to shortsighted decisions.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Example:} If $\gamma = 0.5$, future rewards are valued at half the rate of immediate rewards.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Epsilon ($\epsilon$)} (in Epsilon-Greedy Strategy):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} Controls the exploration-exploitation trade-off.
            \item \textbf{Effect:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item High $\epsilon$ leads to more exploration (e.g., $\epsilon = 1.0$).
                    \item Low $\epsilon$ favors exploitation of known actions (e.g., $\epsilon = 0.01$).
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Example:} An $\epsilon$ value that decays over time helps balance exploration with exploitation.

        \item \textbf{Testing and Tuning:} Hyperparameters typically require tuning through experimental trials to achieve optimal performance.
        \item \textbf{Impact on Convergence:} Adjustments can either accelerate convergence to an optimal policy or lead to divergence; careful tuning is necessary.
