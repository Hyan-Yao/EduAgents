Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan Document

## Project Title:
“Building Intelligent Agents: A Reinforcement Learning Project”

## Course:
Topics in Reinforcement Learning (CS 542)

---

## Project Description
The final project is a collaborative, multi-phase endeavor that applies reinforcement learning (RL) concepts to real-world problems. Teams will identify a problem area, outline a solution, implement an RL algorithm, and evaluate its effectiveness using realistic data.

---

## Project Objectives
1. Demystify and apply RL concepts to real-world issues.
2. Frame real-world problems as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
3. Implement and evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms.
4. Discuss ethical implications and societal impacts of AI solutions.
