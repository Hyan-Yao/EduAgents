\frametitle{Challenges and Considerations in RL}
    \begin{block}{Ethical Considerations and Challenges}
    The integration of RL in sensitive areas raises concerns about:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Bias}: Ensuring fair outcomes across diverse populations.
        \item \textbf{Transparency}: Understanding decision-making processes in RL models.
        \item \textbf{Safety}: Developing RL systems that operate safely in unpredictable environments.
    \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Formula for Understanding Reward Maximization}
    To conceptualize RL, one can refer to the total discounted reward:
    \begin{equation}
    G_t = R_t + \gamma R_{t+1} + \gamma^2 R_{t+2} + \ldots
    \end{equation}
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( G_t \) = return at time \( t \).
        \item \( R \) = received reward.
        \item \( \gamma \) = discount factor (0 \leq \gamma < 1).
    \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
