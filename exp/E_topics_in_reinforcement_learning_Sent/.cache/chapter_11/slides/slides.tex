# Pseudocode for a hierarchical RL approach
class HighLevelAgent:
    def select_subtask(self, state):
        # Logic to choose a subtask based on current state
        return chosen_subtask

class LowLevelAgent:
    def perform_action(self, subtask, state):
        # Logic to perform actions specific to the chosen subtask
        return outcome

# Main loop
for step in range(total_steps):
    subtask = high_level_agent.select_subtask(current_state)
    outcome = low_level_agent.perform_action(subtask, current_state)
    \end{lstlisting}
    This pseudocode snippet demonstrates how hierarchical agents might collaborate, with a high-level agent determining tasks and a low-level one executing them.
