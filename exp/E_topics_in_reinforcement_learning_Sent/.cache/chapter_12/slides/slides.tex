        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} RL is an area of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
            \item \textbf{Example:} Training a self-driving car (the agent) to navigate through traffic (the environment) using rewards (e.g., reaching a destination safely) and penalties (e.g., hitting a curb).

    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations - Key Points}
    \begin{block}{Key Ethical Considerations}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Transparency:} RL models should be understandable to stakeholders. The decision-making process must be interpretable.
            \item \textbf{Fairness:} Deployment must ensure fairness to avoid reinforcing societal inequalities. 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textit{Example:} A job recruitment system favoring candidates based on biased historical data may perpetuate demographic biases.
                \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Performance Evaluation - Overview}
    Performance evaluation is a crucial part of any project, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL). This process involves assessing how well your model performs under specific conditions and according to defined goals. We will explore methods for evaluating project performance, focusing on metrics and evaluation strategies tailored for RL models.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Performance Evaluation - Key Concepts}
    \begin{block}{1. Metrics for Assessment}
        Metrics are quantitative measures used to evaluate the performance of an RL model. Commonly used metrics include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Cumulative Reward}: Total reward accumulated during an episode.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textit{Example}: If an RL agent receives rewards of +10, -5, +20 over three steps, cumulative reward = \(10 - 5 + 20 = 25\).
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Average Reward}: Mean reward over multiple episodes.
                \begin{equation}
                  \text{Average Reward} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} R_i
                \end{equation}
                where \(R_i\) is the reward for episode \(i\) and \(N\) is the number of episodes.
            \item \textbf{Success Rate}: Percentage of episodes where the agent meets its goals.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textit{Example}: If the agent achieves its goal in 8 out of 10 episodes, success rate = \( \frac{8}{10} \times 100 = 80\% \).
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Performance Evaluation - Strategies and Benchmarks}
    \begin{block}{2. Evaluation Strategies}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Offline Evaluation}: Analyzing model performance with pre-collected data.
            \item \textbf{Online Evaluation}: Real-time testing while the model interacts with data/users.
            \item \textbf{Cross-Validation}: Assessing model generalization by splitting datasets into training/testing sets.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{3. Performance Benchmarks}
        Establishing benchmarks is essential for assessment.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Example}: If a new RL model achieves a cumulative reward of 500 with the previous best being 450, this indicates an improvement.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Performance Evaluation - Summary and Conclusion}
    \begin{block}{Summary of Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Use metrics such as cumulative reward, average reward, and success rate.
            \item Employ strategies such as offline and online evaluations, and cross-validation for a comprehensive understanding.
            \item Establish benchmarks for performance assessment and model comparison.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
