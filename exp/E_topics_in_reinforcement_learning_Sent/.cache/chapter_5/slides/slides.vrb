\frametitle{Convergence Rates}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Convergence rate indicates how quickly the DQN's learning process stabilizes.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Graphing cumulative reward vs. training episodes illustrates convergence.
        \item Slope of the graph indicates learning pace.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Interpretation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Fast Convergence: Steep slope suggests rapid learning.
            \item Slow Convergence: Flat curve indicates stagnation.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Cumulative reward is a direct performance indicator.
            \item Tracking convergence rates is crucial for understanding learning efficiency.
            \item Adjustments in hyperparameters can significantly affect outcomes.
        \end{itemize}
