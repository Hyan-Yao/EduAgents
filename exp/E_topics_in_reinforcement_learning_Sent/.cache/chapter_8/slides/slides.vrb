    \begin{block}{Cumulative Reward (R)}
        \[
        R = \sum_{t=0}^{T} r_t
        \]
        where \( r_t \) is the reward received at time \( t \) and \( T \) is the total number of time steps.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Sample Efficiency}
        \[
        SE = \frac{R}{N}
        \]
        where \( R \) is the cumulative reward and \( N \) is the number of interactions with the environment.
