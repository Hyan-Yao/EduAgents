\frametitle{Summary and Key Takeaways - Key Points and Conclusion}
    \textbf{Key Points to Emphasize:}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dynamic programming enhances reinforcement learning through efficient learning and decision-making strategies.
        \item Effective DP implementation reduces computation time for larger and complex problems in real-time.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Critical Formula:}
    \begin{equation}
     V(s) = \sum_{a} \pi(a|s) \sum_{s', r} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \gamma V(s')]
    \end{equation}

    \textbf{Conclusion:}
    Dynamic programming serves as a backbone for reinforcement learning algorithms, providing systematic approaches to evaluate and improve policies, which are vital in uncertain environments.
