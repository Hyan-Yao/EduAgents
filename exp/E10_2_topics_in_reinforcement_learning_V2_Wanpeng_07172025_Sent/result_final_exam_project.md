# Final Project Plan for E10_2: Topics in Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview
**Project Title:** Design and Implement a Reinforcement Learning Solution for a Real-World Application

### Description
This final project provides students with an opportunity to apply reinforcement learning (RL) concepts to develop a practical solution for a real-world problem. Students will investigate an application area, select an appropriate RL algorithm, and present their findings in a structured manner.

## Objectives
1. Comprehensive understanding of RL concepts and algorithms.
2. Evaluation of performance across various RL methods.
3. Implementation in practical scenarios.
4. Conducting independent research and synthesizing findings.
5. Presentation of research findings effectively.
6. Discussion of ethical considerations in AI.
7. Collaboration through group projects.
