Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

1. Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of key concepts and algorithms in reinforcement learning and approximate dynamic programming, evidenced by successfully solving basic RL problems.

2. Critically evaluate the performance of various value and policy approximation methods using defined criteria, and identify suitable applications in real-world contexts.

3. Implement and adapt reinforcement learning algorithms in practical scenarios, focusing on specific domains such as robotics, gaming, and healthcare.

4. Conduct independent research projects that follow a structured process, including hypothesis formulation, literature review, experimentation, and synthesis of findings, contributing original insights to the field of reinforcement learning.

5. Present research findings effectively in various formats (e.g., technical reports, presentations to both expert and non-expert audiences), ensuring clarity and engagement.

6. Analyze and discuss ethical considerations and frameworks in artificial intelligence, applying principles of academic integrity and responsible research practices to all coursework.

7. Engage in collaborative learning through group projects and peer feedback, enhancing teamwork skills and interdisciplinary communication relevant to the AI industry.
