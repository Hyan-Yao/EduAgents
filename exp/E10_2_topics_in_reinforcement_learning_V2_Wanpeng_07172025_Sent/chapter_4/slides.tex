    \frametitle{Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods}
    Monte Carlo Methods are computational algorithms that utilize random sampling to obtain numerical results.
    
    Named after the Monte Carlo Casino, they are effective for problems involving uncertainty and complexity, such as estimating value functions in finance, physics, and artificial intelligence.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Importance in Estimating Value Functions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Value Functions}: Critical in reinforcement learning, they estimate expected returns for actions in specific states, guiding decision-making.
        
        \item \textbf{Estimation through Sampling}: Monte Carlo methods use random sampling to approximate value functions. Simulating many scenarios helps capture the range of possible outcomes and their probabilities.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Random Sampling}: Avoids deterministic biases in estimating values.
        
        \item \textbf{Convergence}: As sample size increases, the estimator converges to the true value—effective for large, complex state spaces.
        
        \item \textbf{Flexibility}: Applicable to a wide range of problems, even those that cannot be solved analytically.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example: Estimating the Value of $\pi$}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Scenario}: Randomly generate points in a unit square (1x1) and count those within a quarter circle.
        
        \item \textbf{Formula}: The area of the quarter circle is $\frac{\pi}{4} \cdot r^2$, with $r = 1$.
        
        \item \textbf{Estimation}: The ratio of points inside the quarter circle to the total number of points, multiplied by 4, approximates $\pi$.
        \begin{equation}
            \hat{\pi} = 4 \cdot \frac{\text{Points in quarter circle}}{\text{Total points}}
        \end{equation}
        - E.g., generating 10,000 points with 7,850 in the quarter circle yields: $\hat{\pi} = 4 \cdot \frac{7850}{10000} = 3.14$.
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Learning Paradigms}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Monte Carlo Methods}:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Learn from complete episodes.
            \item Value estimation is based on the average return of complete episodes of experience.
            \item Requires waiting until the end of an episode to make updates.
          \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Temporal-Difference Learning}:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Updates value estimates based on partial episodes.
            \item Learns from each step by bootstrapping from existing estimates.
            \item Updates can occur in between episodes, which can lead to faster learning.
          \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Data Utilization}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Monte Carlo}:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Uses independent samples to compute the average return.
            \item Not suitable for ongoing learning since it waits for episodes to finish.
          \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Temporal-Difference}:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Uses the current state's value to inform updates before observing the final return.
            \item Can learn in online settings where the agent continuously interacts with the environment.
          \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Monte Carlo}:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Can converge to the correct value function given enough episodes, but requires many episodes for accurate estimates.
            \item High variance due to retraining on episodic returns.
          \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Temporal-Difference}:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Generally exhibits lower variance and can converge faster in practice.
            \item Convergence is guaranteed under certain conditions even with function approximation.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Example of Learning Approaches}
  Consider a simple grid-world environment where an agent moves and collects rewards.
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Monte Carlo Approach}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The agent explores the grid, collecting rewards. 
        \item After completing a full episode (e.g., reaching a goal), it averages the total reward received from each state visited in that episode to update the value function.
      \end{itemize}
  
    \item \textbf{Temporal-Difference Approach}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The agent takes actions and receives immediate rewards. 
        \item After each action, it updates its estimate of the value of states based on the reward received and the expected value of the next state, even before reaching the goal.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  Choosing between Monte Carlo and Temporal-Difference Learning depends on the problem specifics, including the environment dynamics and whether episodic or continual learning is desirable. 
  \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Episode Length}: MC relies on full episodes for updates, whereas TD can update in real-time.
      \item \textbf{Variance and Bias}: While MC can have high variance, TD methods can introduce bias but generally lead to faster learning.

  \frametitle{Off-policy vs. On-policy Monte Carlo Methods}
  \begin{block}{Overview of Monte Carlo Methods}
    Monte Carlo methods are used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn the value of states or state-action pairs based on experience collected through episodes. There are two approaches to how policies are treated during this learning process: \textbf{On-policy} and \textbf{Off-policy}.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{On-Policy Monte Carlo Methods}
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    In on-policy methods, the learning agent evaluates and improves the policy that is used to generate the episodes (trajectories). The agent learns from the policy it is currently following.
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Key Features:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Value estimate is updated based on returns from actions taken by the current policy.
      \item Updates occur after each completed episode, evaluating and improving the same policy.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If an agent follows a policy $\pi$ in a grid world, it learns the value of actions based solely on experiences from $\pi$.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Off-Policy Monte Carlo Methods}
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    In off-policy methods, the agent learns about one policy while following another policy. This allows the agent to evaluate and improve one policy (target policy) based on the returns generated by a different policy (behavior policy).
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Key Features:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Greater flexibility, allowing experiences from different policies.
      \item The target policy can be improved while data is generated from a possibly suboptimal behavior policy.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item An agent might explore states using an epsilon-greedy strategy while optimizing a different policy $\pi^*$ based on returns.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
