    \frametitle{Introduction to Ethical Considerations in Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful branch of AI that enables agents to learn to make decisions by interacting with their environment. 
        While RL offers innovative solutions in various fields—such as robotics, healthcare, finance, and gaming—it also raises important ethical considerations that must be addressed.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Fairness in RL}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: Fairness in RL refers to the principle that decisions made by RL agents must not disproportionately disadvantage or advantage any group based on sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender).
        \item \textbf{Importance}: Ensuring fairness in RL systems is crucial in areas like hiring, lending, and healthcare to maintain trust and prevent biases.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts of Fairness}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Group Fairness}: Different demographic groups receive similar outcomes (e.g., job recommendations should not favor one gender).
        \item \textbf{Individual Fairness}: Similar individuals should receive similar treatment (e.g., candidates with similar qualifications get similar scores).
        \item \textbf{Counterfactual Fairness}: Evaluates outcomes by considering changes in sensitive attributes (e.g., would decisions change if demographics were different?).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Examples and Implications}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Examples of Fairness in RL}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Hiring Process}: Ensure equal consideration for all candidates regardless of demographic traits.
                \item \textbf{Healthcare Recommendations}: Treatment options must be equally applicable across demographics.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Implications for Decision-Making}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Algorithmic Bias: Lack of fairness can perpetuate existing biases, leading to unfair outcomes.
                \item Performance vs. Fairness Trade-off: Balancing fairness constraints with model accuracy is crucial.
                \item Regulatory Compliance: Fairness is relevant for adhering to non-discrimination laws (e.g., GDPR).
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points and Conclusion}
    \begin{enumerate}
