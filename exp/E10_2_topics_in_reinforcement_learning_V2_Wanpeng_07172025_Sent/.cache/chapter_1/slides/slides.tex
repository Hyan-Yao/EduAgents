    \frametitle{Overview of Reinforcement Learning}

    \begin{block}{What is Reinforcement Learning?}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not rely on labeled data but instead learns from the consequences of its actions.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Core Components of Reinforcement Learning}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Agent:} The learner or decision-maker (e.g., a robot, software program).
        \item \textbf{Environment:} Everything the agent interacts with (e.g., a game, a physical world).
        \item \textbf{Actions:} Choices made by the agent that influence the environment.
        \item \textbf{States:} The current situation or configuration of the environment.
        \item \textbf{Rewards:} Feedback signals received after taking actions, indicating success or failure.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{The Learning Process}

    The agent interacts with the environment in a cycle:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Observe the State:} The agent perceives its current state.
        \item \textbf{Select an Action:} Based on its policy, the agent chooses an action.
        \item \textbf{Receive Reward:} After taking the action, the agent receives feedback in the form of a reward.
        \item \textbf{Update Knowledge:} The agent updates its knowledge or policy to improve future actions.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation:} A fundamental dilemma where the agent must balance trying new actions (exploration) against using known actions that yield high rewards (exploitation).
        \item \textbf{Goal of Reinforcement Learning:} To develop a policy that maximizes the expected return (cumulative reward over time).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Real-world Examples}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Game Playing:} Agents learn to play chess or Go by exploring different strategies and learning from wins/losses.
        \item \textbf{Robotics:} Robots learn to navigate environments using trial and error to understand the best paths and actions.
        \item \textbf{Recommendation Systems:} By observing user interactions, agents learn to recommend products or media that maximize user satisfaction.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{A Simple Formula}

    To quantify the goal in RL, we often use the following equation for expected return:
    \begin{equation}
        R_t = r_t + \gamma r_{t+1} + \gamma^2 r_{t+2} + \ldots 
    \end{equation}
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $R_t$ is the expected return starting from time $t$.
        \item $r_t$ is the immediate reward at time $t$.
        \item $\gamma$ (gamma) is the discount factor (0 $\leq$ $\gamma$ < 1), which determines the importance of future rewards.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{What is Reinforcement Learning? - Definition}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning inspired by behavioral psychology, where agents learn how to make decisions through interactions with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and aims to maximize the total cumulative reward over time.

  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Conclusion}
    Understanding these concepts lays the groundwork for exploring more complex frameworks in Reinforcement Learning, such as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) - Overview}
    \begin{block}{What is an MDP?}
        A \textbf{Markov Decision Process (MDP)} is a mathematical framework used to describe an environment in reinforcement learning. It allows an agent to make decisions, modeling situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under agent control.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Significance in Reinforcement Learning}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Provides a foundation for formalizing decision-making processes.
            \item Agents seek to determine an optimal policy (\(\pi\)) to maximize expected cumulative rewards over time.
            \item Allows definition of a value function, which estimates the quality of being in a state.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) - Components}
    MDPs are defined by the following components:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{States (S)}: The set of all possible states in which the agent can find itself. 
        \[
        S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}
        \]
        
        \item \textbf{Actions (A)}: The available actions to the agent. 
        \[
        A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m\}
        \]
        
        \item \textbf{Transition Model (T)}: The probability of moving from one state to another given a specific action.
        \[
        P(s'|s, a)
        \]

        \item \textbf{Reward Function (R)}: Assigns a numerical reward for actions in states.
        \[
        R(s, a)
        \]

        \item \textbf{Discount Factor ($\gamma$)}: Determines the importance of future rewards, where $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) - Example}
    \begin{block}{Example: Simple Grid World}
        Consider an agent in a 3x3 grid that can move in four directions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{States (S)}: Each cell represents a state.
            \item \textbf{Actions (A)}: {up, down, left, right}.
            \item \textbf{Transition Model (T)}: Moving left from (1,1) may lead to:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item (1,0) with probability 0.8 (successful move)
                \item (1,1) with probability 0.2 (bump into a wall)
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reward Function (R)}: +10 when reaching (2,2), -1 for each other step.
            \item \textbf{Discount Factor ($\gamma$)}: Could be set to 0.9 for valuing future rewards.

    \frametitle{Value Functions and Policy}
    Understanding value functions and the concept of policy in Reinforcement Learning (RL).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Value Functions}
    \begin{block}{Value Function}
        A value function estimates how good it is for an agent to be in a given state (the state-value function) or how good a particular action is in a given state (the action-value function).
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{State-Value Function (V(s))}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Represents the expected return starting from state \(s\) and following policy \(\pi\).
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                V^{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}[R_t | S_t = s, \pi]
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If at position A in a maze, \(V(A)\) quantifies the value of being at position A based on expected rewards by following policy \(\pi\) thereafter.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Action-Value Function (Q(s, a))}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Represents the expected return of taking action \(a\) in state \(s\) and following policy \(\pi\).
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                Q^{\pi}(s, a) = \mathbb{E}[R_t | S_t = s, A_t = a, \pi]
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: \(Q(A, Move \; to \; B)\) reflects expected rewards of that action under policy \(\pi\).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{The Concept of Policy}
    \begin{block}{Policy (\(\pi\))}
        A policy defines the behavior of the agent, mapping states to actions. It can be deterministic or stochastic.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Deterministic Policy}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Notation}: \(\pi(s) = a\)
            \item \textbf{Example}: In chess, if the position is X, the next move is always Y.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Stochastic Policy}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Notation}: \(\pi(a|s) = P(A_t = a | S_t = s)\)
            \item \textbf{Example}: In gambling, a policy may give a 70\% chance to hit and a 30\% chance to stand when score is Z.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Value Functions** are essential for evaluating the goodness of states and actions, crucial for decision-making.
        \item Understanding **Policies** allows agents to learn to behave optimally, influenced by their evaluations (value functions).
        \item Reinforcement learning aims to find the optimal policy \(\pi^*\) that maximizes expected rewards via improvements to both value functions and policies.
    \end{itemize}
