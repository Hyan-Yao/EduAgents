- Regular office hours and email support for student queries and feedback.

## Necessary Computing Resources
### Hardware Requirements:
- Access to GPUs and sufficient computing power for simulations and training of reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Availability of computers/laptops capable of running demanding computational tools for all enrolled students.

### Software Requirements:
- Essential software includes:
  - Python with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym.
  - Mathematical modeling tools such as MATLAB, R.
- Course environments should be compatible and ideally pre-installed on campus computers for accessibility.

## Instructional Delivery Context
### Session Duration:
- Course sessions span 2.5 hours necessitating strong pacing to cover complex materials effectively.

### Delivery Format:
- In-person lectures complemented by video lectures and external readings require audiovisual equipment for effective presentations.
- Classroom tools must support mathematical modeling and simulation frameworks effectively.

### Instructional Pacing:
- Ready access to foundational and advanced topics in reinforcement learning is necessary for optimal instructional flow, requiring a well-structured syllabus.

## Scheduling and Facility Limitations
### Classroom Needs:
- Space must accommodate collaboration for group projects and peer feedback effectively.

### Scheduling:
- Coordination of time slots is essential to minimize overlap with other core AI courses, thereby maximizing attendance and engagement.
- TA availability should align with peak hours for student feedback following lectures.

## Policy Compliance
### Academic Integrity:
- Ensure all course materials and assessments comply with institutional academic integrity and accessibility policies.

### Course Content Management:
- Follow university LMS (Sakai) guidelines for submission formats and documentation in course management.

## Additional Considerations and Recommendations
### Faculty Expertise Development:
- Ongoing professional development workshops for instructors on latest reinforcement learning algorithms and ethical AI considerations.

### TA Training:
- Specific training for TAs on reinforcement learning tools and frameworks prior to course commencement.

### Scalability of Resources:
- Utilize cloud computing platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for access to scalable computing resources during simulations.

### Software Accessibility:
- Ensure students have access to necessary software licenses and promote free open-source alternatives for diverse project exploration.

### Mixed-Mode Learning Approaches:
- Utilize asynchronous video lectures along with synchronous meetings for accessibility and increased engagement.

### Interactive Learning Tools:
- Incorporate polling tools during lectures to encourage participation and assess comprehension in real-time.

### Flexible Class Scheduling:
- Consider various class times, including evenings or weekends, to accommodate working professionals or graduate students.

### Facility Constraints:
- Utilize dedicated project spaces or smaller breakout rooms for collaborative projects if overall classroom space is limited.

### Student Orientation:
- Conduct an orientation session to familiarize students with academic integrity policies, accessibility accommodations, and required use of Sakai.

### Content Management Guidance:
- Provide clear instructions on academic integrity, particularly related to external datasets and intellectual property in independent research projects.

## Conclusion
To deliver the "E10_2: Topics in Reinforcement Learning" course successfully, careful planning around faculty expertise, computing resources, instructional delivery, scheduling, and policy compliance is essential. Proactively addressing these constraints through additional strategies will enhance the overall learning experience and meet institutional standards effectively.
