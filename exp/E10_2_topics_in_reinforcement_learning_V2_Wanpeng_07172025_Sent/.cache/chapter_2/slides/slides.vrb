\frametitle{State Value Function - Definition}
    \begin{block}{What is the State Value Function?}
        The **State Value Function**, denoted as \( V(s) \), quantifies the expected long-term return or cumulative reward an agent can expect to achieve starting from a specific state \( s \) while following a specific policy \( \pi \).
    \end{block}

    \begin{equation}
        V^{\pi}(s) = \mathbb{E}^{\pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R_t \mid S_0 = s \right]
    \end{equation}

    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( V^{\pi}(s) \) is the value of state \( s \) under policy \( \pi \).
        \item \( R_t \) is the reward received at time \( t \).
        \item \( \gamma \) (gamma) is the discount factor (0 â‰¤ \( \gamma \) < 1), reflecting the importance of future rewards.
    \end{itemize}
