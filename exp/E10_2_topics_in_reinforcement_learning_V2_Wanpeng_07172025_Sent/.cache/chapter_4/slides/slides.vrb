\frametitle{Historical Background - Key Points & Example}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Points to Emphasize:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Foundational Role:} Monte Carlo methods are foundational in RL, serving both for policy evaluation and action selection.
            \item \textbf{Flexibility:} They adapt well to various types of problems, from board games like Go to complex real-world scenarios.
            \item \textbf{Integration with Deep Learning:} The synergy between Monte Carlo methods and neural networks has led to breakthroughs in AI applications.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Example: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Concept:} MCTS uses random sampling in its search to evaluate potential moves in games.
            \item \textbf{Process:}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Selection:} Traverse the tree based on the selection policy.
                \item \textbf{Expansion:} Add a new node for exploration if an unvisited node is found.
                \item \textbf{Simulation:} Simulate from the new node to get a reward.
                \item \textbf{Backpropagation:} Update the values in the nodes according to the reward received.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Conclusion:} The historical evolution of Monte Carlo methods showcases their adaptability and critical importance to the field of reinforcement learning, influencing both the theoretical foundation and practical applications we see today.
    \end{itemize}
