\frametitle{Importance of Balancing}

    \begin{block}{Dilemma}
        Focusing solely on exploration may lead to missed opportunities for leveraging learned knowledge, resulting in poor performance. Conversely, concentrating entirely on exploitation may prevent the discovery of better alternatives, causing stagnation.

    \begin{block}{Mathematics Behind Balance}
        The exploration-exploitation trade-off can be modeled using algorithms like Îµ-greedy:
        \begin{equation}
        a =
        \begin{cases}
        \text{Random action} & \text{with probability } \epsilon \\
        \text{Best known action} & \text{with probability } 1 - \epsilon
        \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}
