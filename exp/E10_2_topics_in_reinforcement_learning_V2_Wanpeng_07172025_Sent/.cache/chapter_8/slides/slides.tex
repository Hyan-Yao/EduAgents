    \frametitle{Introduction to Exploration vs. Exploitation}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        The exploration-exploitation dilemma is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). It involves balancing two competing strategies to enable effective learning and maximize performance over time.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts: Exploration}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Exploration involves trying new actions or strategies not yet tested by the agent.
        \item \textbf{Purpose:} To gather valuable information about the environment that may enhance decision-making.
        \item \textbf{Example:} A robot exploring different paths in a maze to discover the quickest route to the exit.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts: Exploitation}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Exploitation is using known information to maximize immediate rewards.
        \item \textbf{Purpose:} To achieve the highest possible rewards based on existing knowledge.
        \item \textbf{Example:} Choosing the path in a maze that is already known to lead to the exit quickly.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Importance of Balancing}

    \begin{block}{Dilemma}
        Focusing solely on exploration may lead to missed opportunities for leveraging learned knowledge, resulting in poor performance. Conversely, concentrating entirely on exploitation may prevent the discovery of better alternatives, causing stagnation.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Mathematics Behind Balance}
        The exploration-exploitation trade-off can be modeled using algorithms like ε-greedy:
        \begin{equation}
        a = 
        \begin{cases} 
        \text{Random action} & \text{with probability } \epsilon \\
        \text{Best known action} & \text{with probability } 1 - \epsilon 
        \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points and Conclusion}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Finding the right balance between exploration and exploitation is crucial in reinforcement learning.
        \item Learning strategies develop; thus, parameters for exploration (like $\epsilon$ in ε-greedy) may need adjustments over time.
        \item Mastering this balance broadens applications of machine learning techniques across fields such as robotics and game AI.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Understanding the exploration-exploitation trade-off is foundational in RL, impacting both model success and broader application efficacy.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Understanding Exploration - Definition}
    \frametitle{Understanding Exploration - Definition}
    In the context of reinforcement learning (RL), \textbf{exploration} refers to the process of trying out new actions and strategies to discover their potential rewards. Unlike exploitation, where an agent utilizes known information to maximize immediate rewards, exploration is about uncertainty and learning more about the environment.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Understanding Exploration - Purpose}
    \frametitle{Understanding Exploration - Purpose}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Learning about the Environment:} Exploration allows the agent to gather information about different states and potential rewards that are not already known. This is crucial in dynamic environments where conditions may change.
        
        \item \textbf{Avoiding Local Optima:} By exploring various actions rather than sticking to known ones, agents can avoid getting trapped in local maxima—situations where they may achieve a higher reward than previously, but not the highest possible overall.
        
        \item \textbf{Balancing Knowledge:} Exploration helps ensure a balanced understanding of both the possible actions and their outcomes, contributing to a more robust learning strategy.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Understanding Exploration - Benefits}
    \frametitle{Understanding Exploration - Benefits}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Increased Knowledge:} By exploring more actions and states, agents gain a comprehensive understanding of the environment, which improves decision-making in the long run.
        \item \textbf{Adaptability:} An agent capable of exploration can adjust more effectively to unforeseen changes in the environment, improving its performance in real-time situations.
        \item \textbf{Long-term Reward:} Although exploration may yield lower immediate rewards, it is aimed at discovering strategies that maximize rewards over a longer period.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Understanding Exploration - Examples}
    \frametitle{Understanding Exploration - Examples}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example 1:} In a maze-solving RL scenario, an agent that explores different paths may discover shortcuts or alternative exits that lead to quicker solutions.
        \item \textbf{Example 2:} A recommendation system that only exploits known popular items may miss out on new products that could capture user interest through exploration.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Exploitation - Definition}
    In reinforcement learning (RL), \textbf{exploitation} refers to the strategy of leveraging known information to make decisions that maximize immediate rewards. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Once an agent has explored the environment and gathered enough knowledge, it shifts focus from trying new actions (exploration) to selecting actions that are believed to yield the highest reward based on past experiences.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

            \item Purpose: Discovery of different choices for improved understanding.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploitation}: 
        \begin{itemize}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Trade-off}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Balancing exploration and exploitation is critical to decision-making.
            \item Too much exploitation may lead to suboptimal decisions if not enough information is gathered.
            \item Conversely, excessive exploration may hinder the ability to leverage known rewards.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Optimal Policy}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The goal is to learn an optimal policy that maximizes cumulative rewards.
            \item It often requires a strategic blend of exploration and exploitation.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Examples in Real Life}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix) suggest movies based on past ratings while exploring new genres.
            \item Customers may repeatedly order favorite dishes while occasionally trying new items.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    \frametitle{Importance of Balancing Exploration and Exploitation}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Discusses why balancing exploration and exploitation is crucial for effective learning and decision-making.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding the Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration}: 
        Refers to the strategy of trying new actions to discover their effects. It means venturing outside the known to learn about new possibilities.
        
        \item \textbf{Exploitation}: 
        In contrast, exploitation involves leveraging known information to maximize rewards, focusing on what is already understood to achieve the best possible outcomes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Why Balancing is Crucial}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Maximize Learning}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Excessive exploration can lead to wasted resources as potential benefits remain untapped.
            \item Too much exploitation may result in suboptimal choices since it fails to account for new information.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Avoiding Local Optima}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Sole reliance on exploitation may lead to settling at a local optimum.
            \item \textbf{Example}: A traveler may find one good path and never explore alternative routes that could be shorter or safer.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Dynamic Environments}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Environments are constantly changing; balancing both strategies ensures adaptability.
            \item \textbf{Example}: A company only relying on popular products may fail if customer preferences shift.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points and Illustration}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Trade-Off}: 
        There is a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Finding the right balance is crucial in decision-making.
        
        \item \textbf{Iterative Learning}: 
        Continually adjusting the balance based on feedback leads to improved strategies.

        \item \textbf{Contextual Dependency}: 
        The optimal balance can vary by situation depending on risk tolerance, available resources, and specific goals.
        
        \item \textbf{Illustration Concept}:
        Consider a graph:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{X-axis}: Exploration efforts
            \item \textbf{Y-axis}: Cumulative reward
            \item A balanced approach would show an optimal curve, initially rising steeply and then flattening out.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    Striking a balance between exploration and exploitation is essential for effective learning and decision-making. A successful strategy involves recognizing when to seek new opportunities and when to focus on exploiting existing knowledge to maximize rewards.

    \frametitle{Key Strategies - Epsilon-Greedy}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation:} Selects a random action with probability $\epsilon$ for exploration. With probability $(1-\epsilon)$, chooses the action with the highest estimated reward.
            \item \textbf{Example:} If $\epsilon = 0.1$, there's a 10\% chance of exploring and a 90\% chance of exploiting.
            \item \textbf{Formula:}
            \begin{equation}
                a_t = \begin{cases} 
                    \text{random action} & \text{with probability } \epsilon \\ 
                    \text{argmax } Q(s, a) & \text{with probability } (1 - \epsilon) 
                \end{cases}

    \frametitle{Key Strategies - Softmax and UCB}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{1}
        \item \textbf{Softmax Exploration}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation:} Actions are chosen probabilistically based on their estimated values.
            \item \textbf{Example:} For actions with values $Q(a_1) = 5$, $Q(a_2) = 2$, and $Q(a_3) = 3$, use the softmax function.
            \item \textbf{Formula:}
            \begin{equation}
                P(a_i) = \frac{e^{Q(a_i)/\tau}}{\sum_{j} e^{Q(a_j)/\tau}}
            \end{equation}
            where $\tau$ controls the level of exploration.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation:} Considers the average reward and uncertainty. Actions with higher uncertainty receive a bonus.
            \item \textbf{Example:} UCB favors less frequently explored actions due to their uncertainty.
            \item \textbf{Formula:}
            \begin{equation}
                UCB(a) = \bar{Q}(a) + c \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{n(a)}}
            \end{equation}
            where $N$ is total trials, $n(a)$ is trials of action $a$, and $c$ is a constant.

        \item \textbf{Decaying Epsilon}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation:} Start with a high $\epsilon$ to promote exploration, decreasing over time to favor exploitation.
            \item \textbf{Example:} Start with $\epsilon = 1.0$, reducing to $\epsilon = 0.01$.
            \item \textbf{Formula:}
            \begin{equation}
                \epsilon_t = \epsilon_0 \cdot \text{decay\_rate}^t
            \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Thompson Sampling}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation:} A Bayesian approach sampling based on the probability that actions are the best option.
            \item \textbf{Example:} In multi-armed bandit problems, sample from beta distributions of estimated rewards.
            \item \textbf{Key Benefit:} Adapts naturally to uncertain environments.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Most RL strategies aim for a trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
            \item The choice of strategy depends on the specific problem context.
            \item Understanding various strategies is crucial for designing an effective RL algorithm.

    \frametitle{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy - Introduction}
    The Epsilon-Greedy Strategy is a fundamental approach in reinforcement learning that provides a practical solution to the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma. In environments where an agent needs to choose actions to maximize cumulative rewards, this strategy balances the need to explore new options against leveraging known, rewarding options.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy - Key Concepts}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Exploration}: Trying new actions to discover their potential rewards.
            \item \textbf{Exploitation}: Choosing actions that are known to yield high rewards based on past experiences.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Epsilon (\(\epsilon\))}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Represents the probability of choosing a random action (exploration).
            \item The remaining probability \( (1 - \epsilon) \) is used to select the best-known action (exploitation).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy - How It Works}
    In an epsilon-greedy strategy:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item With probability \(\epsilon\) (e.g., 10\% or 0.1), the agent selects a random action to explore.
        \item With probability \(1 - \epsilon\), the agent chooses the action that has the highest estimated reward based on previous interactions.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
        A = 
        \begin{cases} 
        \text{Random Action} & \text{with probability } \epsilon \\ 
        \text{Best Known Action} & \text{with probability } 1 - \epsilon 
        \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy - Example}
    Consider a scenario with three actions: A1, A2, and A3:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item After initial exploration, the estimated values of these actions are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A1: 1.0
            \item A2: 0.8
            \item A3: 0.5
        \end{itemize}
        \item If \(\epsilon = 0.2\):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item There is a 20\% chance the agent will randomly choose A1, A2, or A3.
            \item There is an 80\% chance the agent will choose the action A1, since it has the highest estimated value.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy - Advantages and Disadvantages}
    \begin{block}{Advantages}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Simple to implement.
            \item Ensures that the agent does not get stuck in local optima by allowing exploration.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Disadvantages}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The fixed epsilon value may not be optimal over time.
            \item A decay strategy, where \(\epsilon\) decreases with time, is often used to focus on exploitation as the agent learns more.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy - Closing Thoughts}
    The epsilon-greedy strategy is a crucial step towards developing effective reinforcement learning algorithms. By managing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, it enables agents to learn from their environment effectively while still capitalizing on the best-known actions. 

    In subsequent sections, we will explore more sophisticated action selection strategies, such as softmax methods, which offer alternative approaches to tackling this challenge.

    \textbf{Remember:} The balance between exploration and exploitation is key to effective learning, and the epsilon-greedy strategy is a foundational tool in achieving that balance.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Softmax function is a method used in reinforcement learning (RL) for action selection.
        \item Balances exploration and exploitation through probabilistic action choices.
        \item Unlike deterministic methods (e.g., greedy selection), Softmax assigns probabilities to actions based on their predicted values.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Softmax Action Selection - Function}
    The Softmax function converts Q-values to probabilities:

    \begin{equation}
        P(a_i) = \frac{e^{Q(a_i) / \tau}}{\sum_{j} e^{Q(a_j) / \tau}}
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(Q(a_i)\): Value associated with action \(a_i\).
        \item \(e\): Base of the natural logarithm, approximately 2.71828.
        \item \(\tau\): Temperature parameter controlling exploration-exploitation trade-off.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Temperature Effects}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Lower \(\tau\): More greedy action selection, favoring higher-value actions.

    % Overview of the UCB algorithm and its significance
    The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm is a method used in reinforcement learning to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. It allows an agent to decide which action to take based on both the estimated rewards of actions and a measure of uncertainty.
\end{frame}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Exploration:} Trying out new actions to discover their potential rewards.
            \item \textbf{Exploitation:} Utilizing known information to maximize immediate rewards.
        \end{itemize}
        \item UCB balances these by encouraging exploration of less-known options while exploiting known high-reward options.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{How UCB Works}
    % Explanation of the UCB mechanics and formula
    UCB operates by assigning an upper confidence bound to each action based on:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The average reward obtained from that action.
        \item The number of times that action has been chosen, reflecting the certainty in the estimate.
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{block}{UCB Formula}
        The UCB value for action \( a \) at time \( t \) is calculated as:
        \begin{equation}
            UCB(a) = \hat{\mu}_a + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln t}{n_a}} 
        \end{equation}
        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( \hat{\mu}_a \) = average reward from action \( a \)
            \item \( t \) = total number of trials (actions taken)
            \item \( n_a \) = number of times action \( a \) has been selected
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example of UCB}
    % Example demonstrating UCB with slot machines
    Imagine a scenario with three different slot machines (arms) with varying average rewards:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Arm 1: \( \hat{\mu}_1 = 0.6 \) (reward after 10 trials)
        \item Arm 2: \( \hat{\mu}_2 = 0.3 \) (reward after 5 trials)
        \item Arm 3: \( \hat{\mu}_3 = 0.4 \) (reward after 8 trials)
    \end{enumerate}
    
    After a few trials:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( t = 23 \) (Total trials)
        \item \( n_1 = 10, n_2 = 5, n_3 = 8 \)
    \end{itemize}
    
    Calculating UCB for each arm:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( UCB(1) = 0.6 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 23}{10}} \)
        \item \( UCB(2) = 0.3 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 23}{5}} \)
        \item \( UCB(3) = 0.4 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 23}{8}} \)
    \end{itemize}
    This helps the agent choose the arm with the highest UCB score.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points & Conclusion}
    % Summary of UCB significance
    \begin{itemize}
        \item UCB is effective in situations with high uncertainty.
        \item It systematically encourages exploration by leveraging confidence intervals.
        \item UCB minimizes regret over time, leading to enhanced long-term rewards.

    \begin{block}{What is Thompson Sampling?}
        Thompson Sampling is a probabilistic approach that helps navigate the exploration-exploitation trade-off in decision-making problems, particularly in the context of the multi-armed bandit problem. It uses Bayesian inference to maintain and update the beliefs about the performance of different options (or arms).
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Exploration}: Trying out less known options to gather more information about their potential payoffs.
                \item \textit{Exploitation}: Leveraging known information to maximize rewards by choosing the option believed to perform best.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Bayesian Approach}:
            Thompson Sampling utilizes Bayes' theorem to update the probability distribution of the expected reward for each action. Instead of a single estimate, we maintain a distribution that captures our uncertainty about the rewards.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Process & Example}
    \begin{block}{How Thompson Sampling Works}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Initialization}: Define a prior distribution for the expected reward of each arm.
            \item \textbf{Sampling}: For each decision round, sample from the posterior distribution of each arm.
            \item \textbf{Selection}: Select the arm with the highest sampled reward.
            \item \textbf{Updating Beliefs}: Update the posterior distribution using the observed reward.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{example}
        \textbf{Example: Bandit Problem with Two Arms}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Arm 1: Expected reward $\sim \text{Beta}(2, 2)$
            \item Arm 2: Expected reward $\sim \text{Beta}(3, 1)$
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{Process}:
        1. Draw samples from both distributions.
        2. Assume Arm 2 gives a higher sample.
        3. Play Arm 2, observe reward +1.
        4. Update the Beta distribution for Arm 2 with the new result.

    The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is a classic example that illustrates the trade-off between exploration (trying new options) and exploitation (maximizing anticipated rewards based on current knowledge).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Definition}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Imagine you are in a casino with multiple slot machines (also known as "one-armed bandits"). Each machine has a different, unknown probability of paying out a prize. Your goal is to maximize your total rewards by deciding which machine to play over a series of rounds.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Trying out different slot machines to gather information about their payout rates.
                \item Essential for discovering potentially high-reward options.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploitation:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Choosing the machine that has provided the highest returns based on the information learned so far.
                \item Focuses on maximizing short-term rewards.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{The Trade-Off}
    Balancing exploration and exploitation is crucial:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Too much exploration may yield little immediate reward.
        \item Too much exploitation may lead to missing out on better options.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Formal Representation}
    In a simplified model, let’s denote:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( K \): Number of slot machines.
        \item \( \mu_k \): True expected reward of machine \( k \) (unknown).
        \item \( X_t \): Reward obtained from playing a machine at time \( t \).
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Goal:} Maximize total reward over \( T \) trials:
    \begin{equation}
        \text{Total Reward} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} X_t
    \end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example Scenario}
    Consider 3 slot machines with unknown payout rates:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Machine 1: 10\% payout
        \item Machine 2: 30\% payout
        \item Machine 3: 50\% payout
    \end{itemize}
    Initially, you should play each machine a few times (exploration) before focusing on the one that seems to pay out best (exploitation).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Algorithms}
    Common strategies for solving the MAB problem include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy}: 
        With probability \( \epsilon \), explore, and with probability \( 1 - \epsilon \), exploit.
        
        \item \textbf{Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)}: 
        Selects machines based on both the mean payoff and the uncertainty (confidence intervals) around their earnings.

        \item \textbf{Thompson Sampling}: 
        A Bayesian approach where machines are selected based on probability distributions reflecting their past performance.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{equation}
      \text{Let } \epsilon \text{ be the exploration rate, where } 0 < \epsilon < 1.
    \end{equation}
    Choose a random action with probability \( \epsilon \) (exploration) and the best-known action with probability \( 1 - \epsilon \) (exploitation).

        In reinforcement learning (RL), agents face a critical dilemma between exploration and exploitation. Understanding this balance is essential for developing effective learning algorithms.
    \end{block}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Definitions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Exploration:} The process of trying new actions to discover their effects and gather more information about the environment.
            \item \textbf{Exploitation:} The application of known strategies to maximize rewards based on existing knowledge.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Summary and Key Takeaways - Part 2}
    \begin{block}{The Trade-Off}
        - The goal is to achieve an optimal policy wherein the agent effectively balances exploration and exploitation.
        - An agent that only exploits may miss out on better long-term rewards by not exploring new strategies.
        - Conversely, too much exploration can lead to suboptimal performance as the agent may fail to consolidate the knowledge gained.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Key Strategies:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Greedy Policy:} Maximizes immediate rewards but can lead to local optima.
            \item \textbf{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy:} 
            \begin{equation}
                a = 
                \begin{cases} 
                \text{random action} & \text{with probability } \epsilon \\ 
                \text{argmax}(Q(s, a)) & \text{with probability } 1 - \epsilon 
                \end{cases}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Softmax Selection:} Assigns probabilities for actions based on estimated values, controlled by a temperature parameter \( T \).

        \begin{itemize}
            \item The exploration-exploitation trade-off is fundamental in RL.
