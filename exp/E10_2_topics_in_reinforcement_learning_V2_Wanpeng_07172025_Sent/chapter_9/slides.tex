    \frametitle{Introduction to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{What are Multi-Agent Systems?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: A multi-agent system (MAS) consists of multiple interacting agents (either cooperative or competitive) that work together or against each other to achieve specific goals in a shared environment.
            \item \textbf{Characteristics}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Autonomy}: Agents operate independently.
                \item \textbf{Interaction}: Agents communicate and affect one another’s actions.
                \item \textbf{Learning}: Agents can learn and adapt based on experiences.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Types of Agents}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Cooperative Agents: Work towards a common goal (e.g., robotic teams).
                \item Competitive Agents: Opposing each other's objectives (e.g., gaming scenarios).
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Significance of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Importance of MARL}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Complex Environments}: Real-world problems often involve multiple entities that influence one another, making single-agent approaches inadequate.
            \item \textbf{Learning Dynamics}: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item With multiple agents, the environment becomes non-stationary since each agent’s actions impact the others, requiring continuous adaptation.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Applications}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Robotics: Coordination of robotic teams for tasks like search and rescue.
                \item Negotiation Systems: Agents negotiating in economic scenarios to maximize profits or satisfaction.
                \item Game Playing: Advancements in AI for games like chess or poker that involve multiple players.
            \end{itemize}

                \item Competition can lead to robustness, as agents learn to strategize against opponents.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Challenges in MARL:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Credit Assignment Problem: Determining which agent's actions contribute to the team's overall success.
                \item Scalability: As the number of agents increases, so do the complications in learning algorithms and interactions.
            \end{itemize}

    This week's focus on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) aims to enhance your understanding of collaborative and competitive interactions in reinforcement learning scenarios. By the end of this session, you will achieve the following learning objectives:
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Learning Objectives - Part 1}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Define Multi-Agent Systems:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Understand the concept of a multi-agent system (MAS) and differentiate between cooperative, competitive, and mixed-mode strategies.
            \item \textit{Example:} In a player versus player game, agents are competitors. In a robotic swarm, agents work together towards a common goal.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Identify Key Components:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Recognize critical elements in multi-agent environments such as agents, environments, states, actions, and rewards.
            \item \textit{Example:} In an autonomous driving scenario with multiple vehicles, each vehicle (agent) navigates (action) while responding to other vehicles and traffic signals (environment).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Learning Objectives - Part 2}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Examine various learning paradigms in MARL such as centralized vs. decentralized learning, and their implications on efficiency and scalability. 
            \item \textit{Emphasis:} Centralized learning relies on a global view for decision-making, while decentralized approaches empower individual agents to learn and adapt independently.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Discuss Challenges in MARL:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Investigate common challenges faced in MARL, including non-stationarity, credit assignment, and scalability issues.

        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Introduce Application Areas:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Highlight real-world applications of MARL in areas such as robotics, traffic management, and economics.
            \item \textit{Example:} Use of MARL for traffic light control systems where multiple lights (agents) coordinate to optimize traffic flow.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Provide an understanding of popular algorithms such as Independent Q-Learning and MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) and how they can be applied in practical scenarios.
            \item \textit{Snippet:}
            \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Example of independent Q-learning update
Q[state, action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * max(Q[next_state]) - Q[state, action])
            \end{lstlisting}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Key Takeaways}

        Understanding the types of multi-agent systems—cooperative, competitive, and mixed—enables better modeling of interactions in MARL environments. Each type presents different dynamics and challenges affecting strategy formulation and learning processes.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Points to Emphasize}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Cooperative systems enhance synergy among agents.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Challenges in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning - Non-Stationarity}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Explanation:} In a multi-agent environment, each agent adapts its strategy while others are learning, creating a non-stationary environment.
        \item \textbf{Example:} In chess, players adapt their strategies based on each other's moves, causing optimal strategies to change over time.
        \item \textbf{Impact:} Difficulty in policy convergence complicates the learning of stable strategies.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Challenges in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning - Credit Assignment Problem}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Explanation:} Outcomes depend on the actions of multiple agents, making it difficult to determine who is responsible for rewards, especially with delayed feedback.
        \item \textbf{Example:} In a team of robots, knowing each robot’s contribution to a task can be challenging if rewards are shared.
        \item \textbf{Solutions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Design individual rewards for contributions.
            \item Use temporal difference methods or eligibility traces.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Challenges in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning - Scalability}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Explanation:} Increasing the number of agents raises interaction complexity exponentially, complicating communication and computation.
        \item \textbf{Example:} Coordinating thousands of vehicles in traffic management presents significant decision-making challenges.
        \item \textbf{Impact:} Results in higher dimensional state spaces and the curse of dimensionality, making learning impractical without efficient methods.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points and Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Dynamic Interaction:} Agents must adapt to each other's actions as well as the environment.
        \item \textbf{Learning Strategies:} Strategies must balance cooperation and competition.
        \item \textbf{Algorithmic Innovation:} Novel algorithms are necessary to manage complexity and improve learning efficiency.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Conclusion:} Understanding challenges in non-stationarity, credit assignment, and scalability is essential for developing effective multi-agent reinforcement learning systems.
