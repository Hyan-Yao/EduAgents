Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan Document

## Project Title: Real-World Machine Learning Application

### Description
The final project for the B4_2 Foundations of Machine Learning course will involve teams selecting relevant real-world datasets to address a specific problem. Students will preprocess the data, apply machine learning techniques, evaluate models, discuss ethical implications, and present their findings through a comprehensive report and presentation.

### Objectives
- Identify real-world datasets from domains such as healthcare, finance, or social media analytics.
- Formulate a specific problem statement and methodological approach.
- Conduct thorough data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- Analyze and discuss ethical considerations regarding data privacy and potential biases.
- Produce a final report and conduct a group presentation of findings.

### Timeline with Milestones

     - Clarity and engagement
     - Response to questions.

### Deliverables
1. Project Proposal (5%)
2. Progress Report (5%)
3. Peer Feedback (5%)
4. Final Submission (Report & Code, 15%)
5. Final Presentation (15%)

**Total Weight**: 50% of the overall course grade.

### Assessment Rubric
1. **Content Accuracy (40%)**: Methods and computation correctness.
2. **Analytical Depth (30%)**: Quality of analysis and drawn conclusions.
3. **Clarity and Presentation (20%)**: Quality of communication in written and verbal formats.
4. **Collaboration and Feedback Quality (10%)**: Team participation and effectiveness of peer feedback.

### Academic Integrity Guidelines
- All submissions must comply with Arizona State University's Academic Integrity Policy.
- Students must complete their work independently and accurately cite all sources.
- Any incidents of plagiarism or academic dishonesty will lead to disciplinary action.

### Feedback Mechanism
- Continuous feedback will be provided after each milestone with instructor comments and peer feedback.
- An end-of-course survey will collect feedback on the project structure and overall learning experience.

### Ethical Considerations
- Discussion on ethical concerns, including data privacy, model biases, and societal implications, is mandatory. 

### Team Structure
- Groups will consist of 4-5 students.
- Collaboration tools: Slack for communication, Trello for project management, Canvas for submissions.
