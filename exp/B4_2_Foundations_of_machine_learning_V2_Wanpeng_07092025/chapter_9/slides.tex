    \frametitle{Machine Learning Techniques}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Overview of core machine learning techniques covered prior to Fall Break.
        As we pause for the Fall Break, let's recap the key machine learning techniques we have explored so far.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Supervised Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Description}: In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled data, meaning that for each input, the output (or class) is known. The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on this training.
        \item \textbf{Common Algorithms}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Linear Regression
            \item Logistic Regression
            \item Decision Trees
            \item Support Vector Machines (SVM)
            \item Neural Networks
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example}: For predicting housing prices, a model can learn from previous sales data where prices (outputs) are associated with features like square footage, location, etc.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{2. Unsupervised Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Description}: Here, models are trained on data without labeled outputs. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns or groupings within the data.
        \item \textbf{Common Techniques}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Clustering (e.g. K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
            \item Dimensionality Reduction (e.g. PCA - Principal Component Analysis)
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example}: Customer segmentation can be done using clustering techniques to group customers based on purchasing behavior without prior labels.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{3. Semi-Supervised Learning \& 4. Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Semi-Supervised Learning}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Description}: This technique combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. It is particularly useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.
            \item \textbf{Example}: In image classification, a model might be trained on a few labeled images and a large set of unlabeled images to improve recognition accuracy.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Reinforcement Learning}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Description}: Models learn to make decisions by taking actions within an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. It’s inspired by behavioral psychology.
            \item \textbf{Key Concepts}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Agent: Learner or decision maker
                \item Environment: What the agent interacts with
                \item Actions: Choices made by the agent
                \item Rewards: Feedback from the environment
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Example}: Training robots to navigate mazes or playing games like chess, where the strategy is refined over time through trial and error.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Training Data}: The quality and quantity of your training data significantly influence model performance.
        \item \textbf{Choosing the Right Technique}: Understanding the nature of your data (labeled vs. unlabeled) guides the choice of machine learning technique.
        \item \textbf{Iterative Process}: Machine learning is iterative, often requiring model adjustments and retraining as new data comes in.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Formulas \& Diagrams}
        \textbf{Linear Regression Formula}: \\
        \begin{equation}
            y = mx + b
        \end{equation}
        Where: \\
        \( m \) = slope (coefficient) \\

    \frametitle{Model Evaluation Metrics - Introduction}
    \begin{block}{Introduction to Model Evaluation}
        Model evaluation is crucial in machine learning, allowing us to assess how well our models perform. Choosing the right metrics helps us understand the strengths and weaknesses of our models, guiding future improvements.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model Evaluation Metrics - Key Metrics}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Accuracy:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Definition:} The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
                \item \textbf{Formula:}
                  \begin{equation}
                  \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{True Positives} + \text{True Negatives}}{\text{Total Instances}} 
                  \end{equation}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model Evaluation Metrics - Accuracy Example}
    \begin{block}{Example: Spam Classification}
        In a binary classification model that predicts whether an email is spam:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item True Positives (TP): 80
            \item True Negatives (TN): 90
            \item False Positives (FP): 10
            \item False Negatives (FN): 20
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{equation}
        \text{Accuracy} = \frac{80 + 90}{80 + 90 + 10 + 20} = \frac{170}{200} = 0.85 \text{ or } 85\%
        \end{equation}
        \begin{block}{Key Point}
            Accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets, where one class is much more frequent than the other.
        \end{block}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model Evaluation Metrics - F1 Score}
    \begin{block}{F1 Score}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two to provide a single score.
            \item \textbf{Importance:} Particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced classes.
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{block}{Formulas}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Precision:} 
                  \begin{equation}
                  \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}
                  \end{equation}
                \item \textbf{Recall:} 
                  \begin{equation}
                  \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}
                  \end{equation}
                \item \textbf{F1 Score:} 
                  \begin{equation}
                  \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
                  \end{equation}
            \end{itemize}

    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model Evaluation Metrics - F1 Score Example}
    \begin{block}{Example: Spam Classification}
        Using the spam classification example:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item True Positives (TP) = 80, False Positives (FP) = 10, False Negatives (FN) = 20
            \item Calculate Precision:
                \begin{equation}
                \text{Precision} = \frac{80}{80 + 10} = \frac{80}{90} \approx 0.89
                \end{equation}
            \item Calculate Recall:
                \begin{equation}
                \text{Recall} = \frac{80}{80 + 20} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8
                \end{equation}
            \item Calculate F1 Score:
                \begin{equation}
                \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{0.89 \times 0.8}{0.89 + 0.8} \approx 0.84
