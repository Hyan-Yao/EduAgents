\begin{frame}[fragile]{Understanding Algorithmic Bias - Definition}
  \begin{block}{Definition of Algorithmic Bias}
    Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and unfair discrimination in the outcomes of machine learning algorithms. It occurs when the model's predictions favor one group over another based on an attribute (e.g. race, gender, age). This bias can arise from:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Input data
      \item Algorithmic design
      \item Broader societal context
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Equity in Outcomes}: Different demographic groups should receive equitable results. Algorithmic bias can perpetuate historical inequalities.
        \item \textit{Example}: A hiring algorithm trained predominantly on resumes of male candidates may score female candidates lower.
      \end{itemize}
      
      \item \textbf{Discrimination}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Unintended Consequences}: Bias can lead to unfair treatment of marginalized groups, exacerbating inequalities in critical areas.
        \item \textit{Example}: Risk assessment tools in criminal justice that are based on biased training data can unfairly label individuals from certain racial backgrounds as high-risk.
      \end{itemize}
      
      \item \textbf{Trust and Acceptance}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Users may decrease trust in AI technologies when they recognize algorithmic bias.
