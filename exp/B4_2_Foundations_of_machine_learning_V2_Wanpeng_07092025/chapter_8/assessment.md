  B) K-Nearest Neighbors
  C) Random Forest
  D) Linear Regression

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Random Forest is a type of ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees.

**Question 3:** What do SVMs aim to find in a dataset?

  A) The centroid of the data
  B) The optimal hyperplane that separates classes
  C) The average of the data points
  D) The minimum loss function

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Support Vector Machines aim to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes.

**Question 4:** Which metric is crucial for evaluating a model's performance in classification tasks?

  A) RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
  B) Precision
  C) R-squared
  D) Mean Absolute Error

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Precision is an important metric to evaluate the accuracy of positive predictions in classification tasks.

**Question 5:** What challenge is commonly faced when implementing advanced supervised learning techniques?

  A) Simple data processing
  B) Lack of computational resources
  C) Ease of model interpretability
  D) Overabundance of training data

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Data quality, model interpretability, and computational resource demands pose challenges in implementing advanced techniques.
