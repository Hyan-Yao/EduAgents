Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

1. **Apply Key Techniques:** Utilize various machine learning techniques (classification, regression, clustering, etc.) to solve problems in specific domains such as healthcare, finance, and social media analytics.

2. **Model Evaluation:** Critically evaluate machine learning model performance using established metrics (accuracy, F1 score, ROC curves) and effectively communicate findings through technical reporting and presentations.

3. **Data Preprocessing Skills:** Conduct thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering, employing techniques like normalization, missing value handling, and encoding categorical variables to improve dataset quality.

4. **Ethical Framework Understanding:** Analyze the ethical implications of machine learning methodologies, including data privacy and algorithmic bias, through case studies and practical scenarios.

5. **Capstone Project Execution:** Execute a comprehensive capstone project that encompasses the entire machine learning workflow—problem identification, model implementation, iterative development, and evaluation—incorporating peer review and collaborative feedback sessions.
