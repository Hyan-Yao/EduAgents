## 1. Assessment Types

### A. Assignments (40% of Final Grade)
- **Total Number**: 5 Assignments
- **Format**: Submission through Canvas in .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) or .pdf.
- **Timing**: Every three weeks, with specific deadlines set in advance.

| **Assignment**    | **Topics Covered**                      | **Weight (%)** | **Submission Format** |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Assignment 1      | Data Preprocessing Techniques           | 8%             | .ipynb                |
| Assignment 2      | Model Implementation - Regression       | 8%             | .ipynb                |
| Assignment 3      | Model Implementation - Classification    | 8%             | .ipynb                |
| Assignment 4      | Ensemble Methods & Evaluation Metrics   | 8%             | .ipynb                |
| Assignment 5      | Ethics in ML & Case Study              | 8%             | .pdf                  |

### B. Capstone Project (30% of Final Grade)
- **Objective**: Implement a comprehensive machine learning solution, from data gathering to evaluation.
- **Milestones**: 
  1. **Project Proposal** (5%): Due Week 6.
  2. **Progress Report** (5%): Due Week 10.
  3. **Peer Review Session** (5%): Week 14.
  4. **Final Project Presentation** (15%): Week 16.

| **Milestone**            | **Weight (%)** | **Details**                                                                                       |
|--------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Proposal                 | 5%             | Submit proposal through Canvas; outlines objectives, approach, and expected outcomes.             |
| Progress Report          | 5%             | .ipynb submission with an update on progress; peer feedback allowed.                             |
| Peer Review Session      | 5%             | Engage in structured feedback with a rubric on peers’ proposals.                                  |
| Final Presentation       | 15%            | Group presentation using slides; evaluated on content, clarity, and teamwork.                     |

### C. Participation and Peer Feedback (20% of Final Grade)
- **Includes**:
  - **Class Attendance & Engagement** (10%): Active participation in discussions and lab sessions.
  - **Peer Feedback Quality** (10%): Quality and applicability of feedback during peer review sessions and discussions.

---

## 2. Question Types
- **Open-Ended Tasks**: Emphasized in projects and assignments for critical thinking and comprehensive analysis.
- **Limited Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**: Occasionally included in quizzes or assignment check-ins to reinforce foundational concepts (not heavily weighted).

---

## 3. Grading Rubrics
Each assignment/project will be assessed based on:
- **Technical Accuracy (40%)**: Correctness of methods and computations.
- **Analytical Thinking (30%)**: Depth of analysis and understanding.
- **Clarity & Presentation (20%)**: Organization and clarity of writing or presentation.
- **Collaboration & Peer Feedback (10%)**: Engagement in peer feedback and teamwork.

---

## 4. Submission Logistics
- All submissions will be through ASU’s Canvas LMS.
- Documentation (.pdfs) and code (.ipynb) should be labeled with student names, assignment titles, and dates.
- Draft submissions for peer feedback should also be submitted via Canvas.

---

## 5. Cumulative Project vs. Traditional Exam
- **Final Cumulative Project**: Replaces the traditional final exam, culminating in mid and final project stages to evaluate cumulative learning.

---

## 6. Feedback and Improvement
- **Continuous Feedback Mechanism**: Structured feedback will be provided after each assignment and milestone.
- **Mid-Semester Surveys**: Gather student input on pacing, content, and teaching effectiveness for adjustments.
