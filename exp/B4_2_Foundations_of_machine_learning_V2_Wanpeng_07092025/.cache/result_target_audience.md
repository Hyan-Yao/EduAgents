Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

### 1) Comprehensive Profile of Target Students

#### Student Demographics and Background:
- **Total Enrollment:** Approximately 150 students
- **Academic Level:** Predominantly undergraduate students
- **International/Domestic Ratio:** 60% international, 40% domestic
- **Academic Background:** Majorly from Computer Science; some from Electrical Engineering and Industrial Engineering  

#### Prerequisite Knowledge:
- **Programming:** Strong foundation in Python programming
- **Mathematics & Statistics:** Basic knowledge present but inconsistent, particularly in probability, linear algebra, and optimization  

#### Career Aspirations:
- Students are seeking careers in technology, data science, and analytics, particularly in sectors using machine learning applications like healthcare, finance, and social media analytics  

#### Identified Knowledge Gaps and Learning Needs:
- **Fundamental Concepts:** Need for reinforcement of key machine learning techniques (supervised, unsupervised learning, neural networks)
- **Tools and Environment:** Varied comfort levels with platforms (e.g., Google Colab, scikit-learn); additional support needed 
- **Mathematics Background:** Gaps in fundamental mathematics relevant for machine learning algorithms (probability, linear algebra)

#### Anticipated Learner Needs:
- **Programming Confidence:** Increased focus on enhancing problem-solving skills related to machine learning 
- **Supplemental Resources:** Access to additional video tutorials and documentation 
- **English Language Support:** Simplification of instructions for international students to aid comprehension of complex concepts

#### Common Challenges:
- **Pacing of Course Material:** Early lectures may be too fast for some students, suggesting the need for differentiated pacing and additional resources 
- **Assessment Preferences:** Preference for project-based learning rather than high-stakes exams indicates the need for more formative assessments 
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Regular assessments on understanding are crucial for timely adjustments in course delivery based on student feedback

### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Differentiated Pacing of Content:**
   - Introduce a foundational module early in the course, allowing focused review sessions to prepare students for advanced material; potentially implement peer tutoring opportunities.

2. **Supplementary Resources:**
   - Develop/collaborate on online resources including video tutorials, reading materials, and interactive exercises, targeting foundational machine learning techniques and necessary mathematical concepts. Host materials on Canvas.

3. **Project-Based Assessment:**
   - Increase formative assessment opportunities; implement smaller projects or quizzes that offer regular feedback and promote collaborative skills through group work.

4. **Implement Feedback Mechanisms:**
   - Establish checkpoints for gathering student feedback on their understanding and pacing through surveys or informal meetings, and adjust course material accordingly.

5. **Engagement Strategies for International Students:**
   - Utilize group discussions, pair programming, and enhance language support materials that explain technical terminology to increase participation and understanding.

6. **Collaboration Tools:**
   - Use tools like Slack or Trello to facilitate communication and collaboration among students during group projects, providing spaces for questions and peer support outside class hours.  

By integrating these adjustments based on data and feedback, the course will better cater to the diverse needs of its students, improving engagement and learning outcomes.
