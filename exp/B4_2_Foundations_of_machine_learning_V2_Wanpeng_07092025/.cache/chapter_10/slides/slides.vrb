    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Initialization}: Select 'k' initial centroids randomly from the data points.
        \item \textbf{Assignment Step}: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on the distance metric.
        \item \textbf{Update Step}: Re-calculate the centroids as the mean of all points assigned to each cluster.
        \item \textbf{Iteration}: Repeat the assignment and update steps until centroid positions stabilize.
    \end{enumerate}
