    \begin{block}{Visualizing the Learning Process}
        Think of supervised learning as a teacher-student model:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The teacher (algorithm) provides information about the data.
            \item The student (model) learns from this information and is tested on new examples.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Open Floor for Questions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What areas do you feel need more clarification?
        \item Are there specific ML concepts or applications youâ€™d like to explore further?
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Encouragement for Engagement:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reflect on how the concepts learned today might apply to real-world problems in your field.
    \end{itemize}
