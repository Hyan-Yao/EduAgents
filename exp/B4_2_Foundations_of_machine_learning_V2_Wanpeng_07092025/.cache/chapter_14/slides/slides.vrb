\frametitle{Understanding Algorithmic Bias - Key Points & Considerations}
\begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Data Matters}: Data used for training often reflects societal biases; ensuring diversity is crucial.
      \item \textbf{Algorithm Transparency}: Understanding decision-making in algorithms aids in identifying biases.
      \item \textbf{Continuous Monitoring}: Regular audits are necessary to identify and mitigate biases in deployed models.
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Considerations for Addressing Algorithmic Bias}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Diverse data sources: Use data that represent various perspectives.
      \item Algorithmic fairness metrics: Employ metrics to evaluate fairness.
      \item Feedback loops: Design systems to learn from mistakes and incorporate user feedback.
    \end{enumerate}
