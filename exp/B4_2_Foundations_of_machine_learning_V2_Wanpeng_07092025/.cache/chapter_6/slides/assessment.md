### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is a key takeaway from studying ensemble methods?

  A) They are not useful.
  B) Mastery of ensemble techniques is crucial for advanced predictive modeling.
  C) They replace all other models.
  D) They require perfect data.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Understanding ensemble methods allows for improved performance in predictive analytics.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is an example of a bagging technique?

  A) AdaBoost
  B) Gradient Boosting
  C) Random Forest
  D) Stochastic Gradient Descent

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Random Forest is a well-known bagging method that uses multiple decision trees.

**Question 3:** What impact do ensemble methods typically have on variance and bias?

  A) Increase both variance and bias.
  B) Decrease variance but increase bias.
  C) Decrease both variance and bias.
  D) Have no effect on variance and bias.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Ensemble methods aim to reduce both variance and bias by aggregating predictions from multiple models.

**Question 4:** What is the main principle behind boosting methods?

  A) To train all models independently.
  B) To combine the results of models trained on random subsets.
  C) To focus on learning from previous model errors.
  D) To reduce the overall number of models used.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Boosting methods sequentially improve learning by focusing on the errors made by previous models.
