  \begin{itemize}
    \item Reinforcement Learning operates on trial and error; the agent explores actions and learns from feedback.
    \item The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards over time through strategic decision-making.
    \item Understanding these components is crucial for developing effective reinforcement learning algorithms.
  \end{itemize}
