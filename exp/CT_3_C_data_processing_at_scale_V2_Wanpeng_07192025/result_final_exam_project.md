# Final Project Plan Document

## Project Title: **Big Data Analysis and Ethical Navigations**

### Description
This final project allows students to engage in a comprehensive data analysis project using real-world datasets. Emphasizing the processing of substantial data volumes through Apache Spark, students will also confront ethical dilemmas in data handling and analysis. This project offers an authentic application of skills learned throughout the course and replaces the traditional final exam.

### Objectives
1. Demonstrate data processing techniques using Spark.
2. Conduct data analysis that interprets and derives actionable insights from large datasets.
3. Utilize specified software tools effectively in collaborative settings.
4. Communicate findings to a non-technical audience through a comprehensive report and presentation.
5. Examine and apply data privacy laws and ethical principles throughout the project.
