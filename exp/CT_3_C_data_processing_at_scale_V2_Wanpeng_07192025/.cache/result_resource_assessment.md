Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: CT_3_C_data_processing_at_scale

## 1. Faculty Expertise Requirements
- **Faculty Expertise**: Instructors must possess extensive knowledge of data processing techniques, particularly with Apache Spark. They should also be well-versed in industry-standard software tools and data privacy regulations to address ethical dilemmas effectively.
- **Qualifications**: A masterâ€™s degree or higher in data science, computer science, or a related field is required, along with prior teaching experience in data analysis or big data courses.

## 2. Necessary Computing Resources
- **Computational Requirements**: 
  - Robust computing power is essential due to the emphasis on large dataset processing. 
  - Students must access cloud computing platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) or high-performance computing clusters.
- **Hardware**: Minimum hardware specifications should include:
  - Laptops/desktops with at least 16GB RAM and a modern processor.
  - A reliable high-speed internet connection to facilitate access to cloud services and online resources.

## 3. Software Requirements
- **Software Tools**: Essential tools include:
  - Apache Spark for data processing.
  - Data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy in Python; R for statistical analysis).
  - Project management and collaboration tools (e.g., JIRA, Trello) for group interactions.
- **Licenses**: Availability of appropriate software licenses needs to be ensured, particularly for proprietary tools, to facilitate student access.

## 4. Scheduling Constraints
- **Class Schedule**: 
  - Assess faculty availability to avoid conflicts with existing course schedules.
  - Align class timing with students' schedules to enhance enrollment potential.
- **Class Size**: 
  - Evaluate the maximum classroom capacity based on available resources, potentially necessitating additional sections or teaching assistant support for larger groups.

## 5. Facility Limitations
- **Physical Classroom Requirements**: 
  - Classrooms should be equipped with sufficient computing devices or allow students to use personal laptops.
  - A technology-enabled environment with internet access and projection capabilities is paramount.
- **Virtual Learning Accommodations**: 
  - If adopting a blended or online format, the chosen platform (e.g., Zoom, Canvas) should support necessary course activities such as group projects and presentations.

## 6. Other Considerations
- **Teaching Assistant Support**: 
  - Assess the availability of teaching assistants to help with course management and support students during project phases.
- **Academic Policy Compliance**: 
  - Develop clear academic policies regarding integrity, collaboration, and grading to maintain transparency and accountability.
- **Improvement Areas**: 
  - Focus on feedback for syllabus restructuring and policy transparency to foster a more effective learning environment.

## Summary
The successful delivery of the "CT_3_C_data_processing_at_scale" course relies on a comprehensive infrastructure, including qualified faculty, robust computational capabilities, appropriate software tools, and suitable facilities. Continuous improvement through feedback integration will enhance course clarity, effectiveness, and user experience for students.
