    \begin{block}{What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?}
        Natural Language Processing, commonly referred to as NLP, is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal of NLP is to enable machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human languages in a way that is both meaningful and contextually relevant.

    \frametitle{NLP Techniques - Introduction}
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an area within artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. To facilitate these interactions, a range of techniques is employed.
    
    Some of the most popular NLP techniques include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Neural Networks
        \item Language Models
        \item Embeddings
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{NLP Techniques - Neural Networks}
    \begin{block}{Description}
        Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons) that process input data and learn from it over time.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Types}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Feedforward Neural Networks:} Simple architecture where information moves in one direction.
            \item \textbf{Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):} Suitable for sequential data; utilize output from previous steps as input for the current step (e.g., text processing).
            \item \textbf{Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:} A type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies and is effective in contexts where historical context is essential.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        An LSTM could be used for tasks like language translation or predictive text input, understanding the context of the sentence based on earlier words.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{NLP Techniques - Language Models and Embeddings}
    \begin{block}{Language Models}
        Language models predict the likelihood of a sequence of words occurring in a text. Types include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{n-grams:} Statistical model where the probability of the next word is based on the previous "n-1" words.
            \item \textbf{Transformers:} Recent model that uses self-attention; backbone for advanced models like BERT and GPT.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{block}{Example}
            \textbf{BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):} Improves understanding context in sentences by considering word relationships bidirectionally.
        \end{block}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Embeddings}
        Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic meanings and relationships.
        
        Common techniques include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Word2Vec:} Represents words in vector space where similar words are close to each other (e.g., "king" - "man" + "woman" = "queen").
            \item \textbf{GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation):} Generates embeddings from global word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{block}{Example}
            Using embeddings in a sentiment analysis model improves the understanding of words like "happy" and "joyful".
        \end{block}
    \end{block}

    \frametitle{Challenges in NLP - Part 1}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{1. Ambiguity}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Ambiguity occurs when a word, phrase, or sentence can be interpreted in multiple ways.
            \item \textbf{Types}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Lexical Ambiguity}: Same word, different meanings (e.g., "bank" can mean a financial institution or the side of a river).
                \item \textit{Syntactic Ambiguity}: Sentence structure leads to multiple interpretations (e.g., "I saw the man with the telescope").
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Challenges in NLP - Part 1 (Continued)}
    \begin{block}{Example of Ambiguity}
        \textbf{Lexical Ambiguity}: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item "He went to the bank to fish."
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Interpretation 1}: He went to a riverbank to fish.
                \item \textit{Interpretation 2}: He went to a financial bank to withdraw money for fishing.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Challenges in NLP - Part 2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{2. Context Understanding}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Refers to the ability to grasp the intended meaning of words or phrases based on their surrounding text and broader situation.
            \item \textbf{Importance}: Effective NLP relies on contextual comprehension.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In the sentence "I can't wait for the party! It is going to be spectacular," the term "it" refers to "the party."

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{3. Language Diversity}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Refers to the multitude of languages and dialects worldwide, each with unique grammar, syntax, and vocabulary.
            \item \textbf{Challenges}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Morphology and Syntax}: Different languages have various rules for constructing sentences.

        Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies offer powerful tools for communication and data processing. However, as these technologies evolve, several ethical concerns arise, notably:
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Bias in NLP Models}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Explanation:} Models can reflect or amplify biases present in training data, leading to unfair and discriminatory outcomes.
        \item \textbf{Example:} A sentiment analysis model trained primarily on reviews from one demographic may misinterpret sentiments expressed by others.
        \item \textbf{Illustration:} Consider a job recruitment tool that shows bias against certain ethnicities due to biased training data, resulting in overlooking qualified candidates.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Misinformation and Data Privacy Concerns}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Misinformation and Manipulation:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation:} NLP technologies can generate misleading content, facilitating the spread of misinformation.
            \item \textbf{Example:} Deepfake texts or AI-generated articles can misrepresent facts, leading to public confusion, such as during elections or health crises.
            \item \textbf{Key Point:} Misinformation control is critical; developers must ensure technologies are not exploited to manipulate public opinion.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Data Privacy Concerns:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation:} NLP applications often require large datasets, raising issues about how personal data is collected, used, and stored.
            \item \textbf{Example:} Models like GPT-3 are trained on massive text datasets from the internet, which may include private user data, raising concerns about sensitive information.
            \item \textbf{Key Point:} Implementing data protection measures such as anonymization and consent policies is crucial.
