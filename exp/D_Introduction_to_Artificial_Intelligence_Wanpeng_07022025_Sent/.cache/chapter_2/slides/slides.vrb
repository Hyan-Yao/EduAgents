\frametitle{2. Decision Trees}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure that makes decisions based on asking a series of questions. Each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of that test, and each leaf node represents a class label (or regression output).

    \begin{block}{Example}
        Deciding whether to play outside based on weather conditions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Is it raining?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Yes: Stay indoors
                \item No: Check temperature
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Is it too hot?
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Yes: Stay indoors
                        \item No: Go outside
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize but can be prone to overfitting.
