**Frame 2:**  
When we talk about bias in AI, we are referring to the systematic favoritism or prejudice that can occur in AI algorithms. This means that certain groups may be unfairly treated due to inherent biases in the data these systems learn from.

For instance, consider **recruitment tools**. If an AI model is trained on historical hiring data, which might inherently favor candidates from a certain gender or ethnicity, it may replicate or even amplify those biases in its future hiring recommendations. Likewise, in the case of **facial recognition systems**, studies have shown that these systems often exhibit higher error rates for people of color when compared to their white counterparts. This raises pressing concerns about racial bias. 

Unchecked bias in AI can perpetuate stereotypes, create unequal opportunities, and ultimately undermine trust in these technologies. It's essential to recognize that bias in AI isn't just a technical issue; it has profound ethical implications that can ripple through society.

**[Transition to Frame 3]**  
Now, let’s explore **Transparency** in AI systems.

**Frame 3:**  
**Transparency** refers to the ability of users and stakeholders to understand how AI systems arrive at decisions. This leads us to the infamous **black box problem**. Many AI systems, particularly those utilizing deep learning, operate in ways that feel opaque—a “black box.” Users may not understand how decisions are made, which creates a barrier to trust.

To counter this, researchers are diving into **Explainable AI**, or XAI, which aims to develop algorithms that not only provide results but also clear explanations for their actions. Think of it like this: if you are making a decision that significantly affects someone's life, wouldn't you want to know not just the outcome but also how that outcome was derived? Transparency fosters accountability. It ensures users have the ability to question and challenge AI decisions, which is a fundamental aspect of trust.

Furthermore, let's consider the **Societal Impact** of AI. AI technologies can drastically affect various aspects of society, from employment to privacy concerns.

We must acknowledge that while automation through AI may enhance efficiency, it also poses challenges. For example, we might see job displacement in sectors like manufacturing, where machines could replace human labor.
