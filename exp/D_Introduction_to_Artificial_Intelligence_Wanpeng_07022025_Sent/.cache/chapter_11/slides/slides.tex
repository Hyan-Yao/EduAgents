    In the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the success of any project hinges on two core components:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Effective Communication:} The ability to exchange information clearly among team members, stakeholders, and end-users through various forms such as verbal, written, and visual communication.
        \item \textbf{Collaboration:} Working jointly with others, often in interdisciplinary teams, to achieve a common objective combining insights from multiple fields.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
