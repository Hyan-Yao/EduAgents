\frametitle{Getting Started with TensorFlow - Summary}
    \begin{block}{Summary of Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item **Installation**: Use pip for TensorFlow installation and consider GPU support.
            \item **Model Creation**: Utilize sequential models for structure, flatten inputs, and define output layers.
            \item **Training \& Evaluation**: Use \texttt{.fit} to train and \texttt{.evaluate} to gauge model performance.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    By following these steps, you can efficiently set up your first machine learning model using TensorFlow!
