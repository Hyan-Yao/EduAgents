Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

### 1) Comprehensive Profile of Target Students

**Typical Student Background**:
- Varied academic backgrounds primarily in Computer Science, Data Science, Information Technology, Statistics, or analytical disciplines.
- Mix of undergraduate and graduate students aiming to enhance technical skills for roles in data analysis and decision-making.

**Prerequisite Knowledge**:
- Fundamental understanding of statistics and probability.
- Proficiency in Python programming, including libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn.
- Familiarity with data structures and algorithms.

**Career Aspirations**:
- Aspiring roles include Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, and positions in business intelligence or analytics.

**Potential Knowledge Gaps**:
- Lack of hands-on experience with data mining tools and real-world datasets.
- Insufficient exposure to advanced topics like neural networks and generative models.
- Limited understanding of model evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves).

**Learning Needs**:
- **Hands-On Learning**: Practical assignments integrating theory with real-world application using tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Collaborative Projects**: Opportunities for group work to develop teamwork and communication skills.
- **Additional Resources**: Remedial guides in Python programming and statistics to ensure student engagement.
- **Understanding of Policies**: Clarity on ethical considerations and institutional data use policies.

### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Integrate Learning Objectives**: Merge course content on model evaluation with classification algorithms to promote cohesive learning.

2. **Cover Advanced Topics**: Expand the curriculum to include neural networks and deep learning techniques with dedicated workshops or additional sessions.

3. **Accessibility of Tools**: Enhance accessibility to collaborative tools (e.g., GitHub) by providing tutorials or resources for students less familiar with version control.

4. **Updated Syllabus**: Revise the syllabus to clearly outline institutional policies (academic integrity, ethical practices, disability accommodations), fostering transparency and reassurance for students.
