\frametitle{Hierarchical Clustering - Dendrograms}
    \begin{block}{Dendrogram Representation}
        A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram that visually represents the arrangement of clusters formed by hierarchical clustering.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Vertical axis: Represents the distance between clusters.
        \item Horizontal axis: Represents individual data points.
        \item Shorter branches indicate closer clusters.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \item No predefined number of clusters
        \item Versatility in applications (e.g., market segmentation)
        \item Different linkage criteria can affect dendrogram shape:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item **Single Linkage**: Min distance between points in clusters
                \item **Complete Linkage**: Max distance between points in clusters
                \item **Average Linkage**: Average of distances between points
            \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
