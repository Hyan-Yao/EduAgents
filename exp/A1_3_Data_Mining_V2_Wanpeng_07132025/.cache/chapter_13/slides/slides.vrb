\frametitle{Questions for Reflection}
    To guide your reflection, consider the following questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{What were the main goals of your project?}
            Think about whether you achieved these goals and how they align with your expectations.
        \item \textbf{What challenges did you face during the project?}
            Reflect on these difficulties and how they impacted your approach or outcomes.
        \item \textbf{How did your understanding of the subject evolve?}
            Evaluate how your perceptions or beliefs about the topic changed throughout the project.
        \item \textbf{What skills did you develop?}
            Identify both technical skills (like data analysis or project management) and soft skills (like teamwork or communication).
    \end{enumerate}
