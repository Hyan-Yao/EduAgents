    \begin{block}{Pruning Redundant Rules}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Redundant Rules}: Rules that provide no new information as they are implied by stronger rules.
            \item \textbf{Pruning Approaches}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Support and Confidence Thresholds: Discard low support or confidence rules.
                \item Subset Rules: Remove rules that are subsets of stronger ones (e.g., if \{Bread, Butter\} ⇒ \{Jam\} is stronger, discard \{Bread\} ⇒ \{Jam\}).
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Importance of Domain Knowledge}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Understanding Context: Improves result interpretation (e.g., knowing more milk is bought in summer).
            \item Prioritization of Rules: Helps determine which rules are more actionable.
        \end{itemize}
