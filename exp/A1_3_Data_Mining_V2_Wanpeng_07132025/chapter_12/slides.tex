        As data mining grows in prevalence and complexity, it brings forth critical ethical considerations. Below are three fundamental ethical principles relevant to data mining:
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Ethical Concepts - Autonomy}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Autonomy}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Definition:} Autonomy refers to the right of individuals to make informed decisions about their own lives and personal information. In the context of data mining, it emphasizes the need for individuals to have control over their data.
                \item \textbf{Example:} Before collecting data from users, companies should obtain explicit consent, ensuring that users understand what data is being collected and how it will be used (e.g., by providing clear privacy notices).
                \item \textbf{Key Point:} Upholding autonomy fosters trust and transparency, enhancing user willingness to share data responsibly.
            \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Ethical Concepts - Justice}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{1}  % Continue numbering from the previous frame
        \item \textbf{Justice}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Definition:} Justice is the principle of fairness in the distribution of benefits and burdens among individuals. It raises concerns about ensuring equitable access to data benefits and protection against data misuse.
                \item \textbf{Example:} When utilizing algorithms that analyze demographic data, it is imperative to avoid bias that could discriminate against specific groups (e.g., age, race, gender). For instance, if a predictive policing model disproportionately targets minority communities, it raises serious justice issues.
                \item \textbf{Key Point:} Ethical data mining must ensure that all individuals are treated equitably, and decisions based on data do not reinforce systemic inequalities.
            \end{itemize}
