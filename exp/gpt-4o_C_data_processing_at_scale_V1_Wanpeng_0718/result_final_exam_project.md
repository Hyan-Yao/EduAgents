### Project Type
Team-Based Capstone Project

### Duration
14 Weeks

---

### Project Description
In this capstone project, students will work in teams of 4-5 to tackle a real-world data processing challenge presented by industry partners. The project will involve the end-to-end design and implementation of a scalable data pipeline that utilizes Apache Spark, Hadoop, or a cloud-based solution (AWS, GCP, Azure). Each team will present their findings to a mock stakeholder panel, demonstrating both technical and non-technical communication skills.

### Project Learning Objectives
1. Understand Data Processing Concepts
2. Utilize Data Processing Tools
3. Develop Data Pipelines
4. Ensure Data Security and Compliance
5. Employ Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving
6. Consider Ethical Implications
7. Effective Communication
