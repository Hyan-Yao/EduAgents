### Learning Objectives for Data Processing at Scale Course

1. **Understanding Data Processing Concepts**
   - Compare and contrast batch processing and stream processing through a case study analysis.
   - Articulate the benefits and challenges of processing large datasets effectively.

2. **Proficiency in Data Processing Tools and Technologies**
   - Utilize Apache Spark, Hadoop, and cloud-based data processing services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure) to complete a capstone project in collaboration with industry partners, addressing real-world data processing challenges.

3. **Data Pipeline Development**
   - Design and implement scalable data pipelines using version control (e.g., Git) that integrate data from multiple sources, ensuring data quality and reliability.

4. **Data Security and Compliance**
   - Conduct a compliance audit on a hypothetical data processing scenario, applying necessary security measures according to relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

5. **Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving**
   - Troubleshoot specific case studies involving common data inaccuracies (e.g., missing values and outliers) to develop effective problem-solving frameworks and strategies.

6. **Ethical Considerations in Data Processing**
   - Develop a proposal for an ethics review board on a proposed data project, detailing ethical considerations and mitigation strategies associated with data processing.

7. **Industry Collaboration and Communication Skills**
   - Present project results to a mock stakeholder panel, effectively communicating technical findings tailored to both technical and non-technical audiences.
