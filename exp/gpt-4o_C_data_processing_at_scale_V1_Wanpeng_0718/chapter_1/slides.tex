    \frametitle{Understanding Batch Processing - Definition}
    \begin{block}{Definition of Batch Processing}
        Batch processing is a method of executing a series of jobs or tasks on a computer system without manual intervention. 
        Data is collected over a period and processed as a single unit, or "batch," rather than handling inputs one at a time.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Non-Interactive}: Executed without user interaction; users submit jobs for automatic processing.
        \item \textbf{Efficient Resource Utilization}: Optimizes CPU and memory through job grouping.
        \item \textbf{Time-Consuming}: Sequential job processing may introduce delays.
        \item \textbf{Scheduling}: Jobs typically scheduled for off-peak times to maximize resource usage.
        \item \textbf{Error Handling}: Errors logged for review post-processing rather than addressed immediately.
    \end{enumerate}
