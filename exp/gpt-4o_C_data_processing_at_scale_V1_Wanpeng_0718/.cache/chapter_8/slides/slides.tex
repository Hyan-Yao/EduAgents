    \frametitle{Access Control Mechanisms - Introduction}
    \begin{block}{Introduction to Access Control}
        Access control is a fundamental aspect of data security that determines who is allowed to access and use information and resources in a computing environment. 
        Properly implemented access control mechanisms help protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and abuse.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Access Control Models}
    There are several access control models used in data security. This slide focuses on two prominent models:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Discretionary Access Control (DAC)}
        \item \textbf{Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Access Control Mechanisms - DAC}
    \textbf{1. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} In DAC, the owner of the resource decides who has access.
        \item \textbf{How it Works:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Each user has a set of permissions for each resource.
            \item Permissions can include read, write, and execute, among others.
            \item Users can pass on their access rights to other users (hence "discretionary").
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example:} A file owned by User A can be shared with User B for editing, while User C is restricted from access.
        \item \textbf{Advantages:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Flexibility in granting permissions.
            \item Lightweight and easy to implement.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Disadvantages:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Higher risk of unauthorized access due to user-managed permissions.
            \item Inconsistent permission levels may arise across the organization.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Access Control Mechanisms - RBAC}
    \textbf{2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Access decisions are based on roles assigned to users rather than their identity.
        \item \textbf{How it Works:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Roles (e.g., Administrator, Manager, Employee) are defined.
            \item Permissions associated with these roles dictate access.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example:} Users in the 'Manager' role can access financial reports; 'Employee' role users can access their personal files.
        \item \textbf{Advantages:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Streamlines permission management.
            \item Reduces the risk of excessive permissions (principle of least privilege).
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Disadvantages:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Requires careful planning and definition of roles.
            \item Changes in roles may complicate permission adjustments.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points and Summary}
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Importance of Access Control:} Ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive data, reducing the risk of breaches.
            \item \textbf{Choosing the Right Model:} Organizations must assess needs and security risks to determine the appropriate model.
            \item \textbf{Compliance Requirements:} Regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) can influence the choice of mechanisms.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Summary}
        Access control mechanisms are vital for safeguarding organizational data. Understanding DAC and RBAC enhances security and management efficiency.
