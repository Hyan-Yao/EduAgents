\frametitle{Data Encryption Techniques - Key Points and Summary}
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Confidentiality:} Protects data confidentiality in both types.
            \item \textbf{Choosing the Right Method:} Depends on security requirements (speed vs. security).
            \item \textbf{Real-World Application:} Used in secure communications, online transactions, and data storage.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Summary}
        Encryption is vital for data security strategies, and understanding both symmetric and asymmetric encryption equips organizations to protect sensitive information.

    \begin{block}{Diagram: Basic Comparison}
        \texttt{
            [Symmetric] \\
            Encryption <----> Decryption \\
            Key: Same \\

            [Asymmetric] \\
            Encryption (Public Key) ---> Decryption (Private Key)
        }
    \end{block}

    \textit{Remember: Always practice good key management and use secure algorithms for effective encryption!}
