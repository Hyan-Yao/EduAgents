    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{4. Informed Consent}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Description:} Users should be fully aware of how their data will be used at the time of collection. Transparency is critical for ethical data practices.
            \item \textbf{Example:} Apps requiring users to allow access to personal information (like location) must clearly articulate the purpose and how it benefits the user.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{5. Data Security}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Description:} Organizations must implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data from breaches and unauthorized access.
            \item \textbf{Example:} Use of encryption and secure channels for transmitting personal information helps safeguard data integrity.
        \end{itemize}
