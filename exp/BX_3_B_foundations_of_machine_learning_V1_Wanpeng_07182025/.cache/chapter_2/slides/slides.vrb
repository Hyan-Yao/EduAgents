\frametitle{Conclusion - Key Points and Ethical Considerations}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Training and Testing:}
        Split data into training and test sets for evaluation.

        \item \textbf{Common Algorithms:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Linear Regression for regression tasks.
            \item Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM for classification tasks.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Evaluation Metrics:}
        Important metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error (MSE).

        \item \textbf{Ethical Considerations:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Bias in Training Data can perpetuate unfair outcomes.
            \item Accountability in Decision-Making is vital.
        \end{itemize}
