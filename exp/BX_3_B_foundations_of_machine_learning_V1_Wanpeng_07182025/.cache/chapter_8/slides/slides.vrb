\frametitle{Questions and Discussion - Engagement Activity}

  \begin{block}{Discussion Points}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item What challenges have you faced when tuning hyperparameters?
    \item Which tuning methods do you find most effective, and why?
    \item How do hyperparameters influence bias-variance trade-offs?
    \item Can you share any best practices or tools you've used for hyperparameter optimization?
  \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Engagement Activity}
    Consider a model you've worked with:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Identify two hyperparameters you tinkered with.
      \item Share the impact on model performance with a classmate.
    \end{enumerate}

    Feel free to raise any questions or share experiences related to hyperparameter tuning. Your thoughts and insights can deepen our understanding of this pivotal aspect of machine learning!
