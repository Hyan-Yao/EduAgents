            \item Data Preprocessing
            \item Algorithm Application
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{1. Data Collection}
    Data collection is the foundational step in any machine learning project. It involves gathering relevant data from various sources to build a suitable dataset for model training.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Sources of Data:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Public Datasets: Websites like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository.
            \item APIs: Use APIs from various platforms (e.g., Twitter API for tweets).
            \item Web Scraping: Extracting data from websites using tools like Beautiful Soup (Python).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        For building a model to predict house prices, data might be collected from:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Real estate websites for historical pricing.
            \item Government databases for census data.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ensure data is relevant and diverse.
            \item Document the sources of your data for reproducibility.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{2. Data Preprocessing}
    Data preprocessing prepares your dataset for the machine learning model by ensuring quality and compatibility. This step often includes:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data Cleaning:} Removing duplicates, handling missing values.
        \item \textbf{Data Transformation:} Normalizing or scaling features. For instance, using Min-Max scaling:
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{equation}
            X' = \frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}
        \end{equation}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Feature Selection:} Identifying and retaining the most impactful features; dimensionality reduction can involve techniques like PCA.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        For the house price prediction model, if there are missing values in the square footage column, they could be filled with the column mean or median value.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Clean, well-prepared data leads to better model performance.
            \item Always visualize data before and after preprocessing.
