Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan: Collaborative Machine Learning Application

## Project Overview
Each team will collaboratively design and implement a machine learning solution to address a real-world problem within a chosen domain such as healthcare, finance, or agriculture. This project emphasizes teamwork, analytical thinking, ethical considerations, and practical application of machine learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Develop collaboration and communication skills within diverse teams.
- Apply machine learning methodologies to solve real-world problems.
- Enhance analytical thinking by conducting literature reviews and adapting existing methods.
- Adhere to ethical standards in data handling and application.

## Timeline with Milestones
- **Week 8:** 
  - **Progress Report 1 Due**
    - Document progress, challenges, and next steps.
  
- **Week 10:**
  - **Project Proposal Due**
    - Title, problem statement, literature review, methodology, and data sources.
    
- **Week 12:** 
  - **Progress Report 2 Due**
    - Similar format to Progress Report 1, with updated content.

- **Week 13:**
  - **Final Project Submission Due**
    - Written report, code implementation, and final presentation.
  
- **Week 13:** 
  - **Final Presentation**
    - Oral delivery of project findings and demonstration.
