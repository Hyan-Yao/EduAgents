\begin{frame}[fragile]{Learning Outcomes Reflection - Overview}
    \frametitle{Overview of Machine Learning Concepts}
    In this section, we will reflect on the fundamental concepts of machine learning that you have learned throughout the course, focusing on \textbf{supervised} and \textbf{unsupervised learning}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Learning Outcomes Reflection - Supervised Learning}
    \frametitle{1. Supervised Learning}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data. The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs, essentially learning from the "supervision" of labeled data.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Characteristics:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Labeled Data: Each training example contains both input features (independent variables) and the output (dependent variable).
            \item Objective: Predict the output for new, unseen instances.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Common Algorithms:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Linear Regression
            \item Support Vector Machines (SVM)
            \item Decision Trees
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Example:}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Task: Predict housing prices based on features.
            \item Data: Input - Size (sq ft), Location (categorical), Bedrooms (numeric) \\
                  Output - Price ($)
          \end{itemize}
          
        \item \textbf{Formula for Linear Regression:}
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Size} + \beta_2 \times \text{Location} + \beta_3 \times \text{Bedrooms} 
        \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Learning Outcomes Reflection - Unsupervised Learning}
    \frametitle{2. Unsupervised Learning}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data without any labeled responses. The goal is to infer the natural structure present within a set of data points.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Characteristics:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unlabeled Data: The model works with input features only, without corresponding output labels.
            \item Objective: Find patterns, groupings, or associations in the data.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Common Algorithms:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item K-Means Clustering
            \item Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
            \item Hierarchical Clustering
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Example:}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Task: Segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior.
            \item Data: Input - Age, Income, Spending Score
          \end{itemize}
          
        \item \textbf{Illustrative Concept:}

    \textbf{Linear Regression}:
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable \( Y \) and one or more independent variables \( X \). It assumes a linear relationship.
    \end{block}
    \begin{equation}
        Y = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + ... + b_nX_n + \epsilon
    \end{equation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( Y \): dependent variable (outcome)
        \item \( X_n \): independent variables (predictors)
        \item \( b_n \): coefficients (weights)
        \item \( \epsilon \): error term
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Predicting housing prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, etc. Sample equation:
        \[
        \text{Price} = 20000 + 150 \times \text{SquareFootage} + 10000 \times \text{Bedrooms}
        \]
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Algorithm Applications - Decision Trees}
    \textbf{Decision Trees}:
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        A flowchart-like tree structure where each internal node represents a feature (attribute), each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome (class label).
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Classifying whether a customer will buy a product based on age and income:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Node 1: Is Age > 30?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Yes: Node 2: Is Income > \$50k?
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Yes: Buy
                    \item No: Don't Buy
                \end{itemize}
                \item No: Don't Buy
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

            \item Input Layer: Accepts input features.
            \item Hidden Layers: Intermediate processing via activation functions.
            \item Output Layer: Produces final predictions or classifications.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In image recognition, a neural network can classify images of cats vs. dogs by learning features such as shapes, colors, and patterns.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Training Process}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Forward Propagation: Pass inputs through the network to get predictions.
            \item Loss Calculation: Compare predictions with actual outcomes.
