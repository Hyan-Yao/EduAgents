    \begin{block}{Understanding Bias}
        Bias refers to systematic errors in the predictions of machine learning algorithms that stem from prejudiced assumptions or skewed datasets.
        It can produce unfair outcomes, leading to negative consequences in decision-making processes.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{How Bias Manifests in Algorithms}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Data Bias}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Training data reflects societal prejudices or is unrepresentative.
            \item \textit{Example}: A facial recognition system poorly identifies darker-skinned individuals due to bias in training data.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Algorithmic Bias}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Design and implementation can lead to inherent biases.
            \item \textit{Example}: An algorithm may favor candidates from certain demographic backgrounds based on biased historical hiring data.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Feedback Loops}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Biased predictions inform future training datasets, creating a cycle.
            \item \textit{Example}: Predictive policing tools can reinforce bias by leading to more arrests in already targeted neighborhoods.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Implications of Bias in Decision-Making}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Social Inequality}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Biased algorithms can exacerbate existing inequalities (e.g., biased credit scoring models).
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Legal Consequences}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Organizations may face lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny due to biased outcomes.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Trust and Reputation}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Deploying biased algorithms can damage reputation and consumer trust.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Evaluating Bias and Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Types of Bias}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Sample Bias}: Unequal representation in training data.
            \item \textit{Measurement Bias}: Inaccuracies in data collection.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Fairness Metrics}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Disparity Metrics}: Compare false positive/negative rates across groups.
            \item \textit{Calibration}: Match predicted probabilities with observed outcomes.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example of a Fairness Metric: Equal Opportunity}
    In a binary classification context, Equal Opportunity is defined as providing equal true positive rates across different demographic groups:
    
    \begin{equation}
    \text{Equal Opportunity} = P(Y=1 | \text{Predicted} = 1, \text{Group} A) = P(Y=1 | \text{Predicted} = 1, \text{Group} B)
    \end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Strategies for Mitigating Bias}

        \item \textbf{Diverse Datasets}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ensure data diversity that includes various demographic groups.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Bias Audits}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Regularly assess algorithms for biases before deployment.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Inclusive Team Composition}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Diverse teams can identify biases that homogeneous teams may overlook.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Transparent Algorithms}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Build public trust by enhancing algorithmic transparency in decision-making.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

        \item \textbf{Right to be Forgotten}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item GDPR allows data deletion requests, but compliance can be slow.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Discrimination}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Biased algorithms perpetuate social inequalities.
