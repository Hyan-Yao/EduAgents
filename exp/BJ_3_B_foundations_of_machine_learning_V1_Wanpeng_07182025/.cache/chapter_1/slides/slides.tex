    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Unlike supervised learning, the agent learns from the consequences of its actions rather than being explicitly told what to do.

        \item \textbf{Actions:} Choices made by the agent affecting the environment's state.
        \item \textbf{States:} Current situation descriptions of the agent with respect to the environment.
        \item \textbf{Rewards:} Feedback received after an action, guiding the learning process.
        \item \textbf{Policy:} The strategy that dictates actions based on the current state.

        \item The environment returns a reward $R_t$ for the action taken.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Mathematical Representation}
        The state-action-reward-state (SARS) update can be expressed as:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item $V(S)$ = Value of state $S$
            \item $R_t$ = Reward received after action $A_t$
