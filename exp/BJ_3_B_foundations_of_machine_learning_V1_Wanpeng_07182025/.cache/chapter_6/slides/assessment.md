- Encourage critical thinking about unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering.
- Foster discussion on how clustering impacts various fields including marketing, healthcare, and image processing.
- Develop practical skills in evaluating clustering algorithms and understanding their applications.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** Which of the following statements best describes clustering?

  A) Clustering is a supervised learning technique.
  B) Clustering groups data based on similarities.
  C) Clustering requires labeled data for analysis.
  D) Clustering is primarily used for regression tasks.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data points based on their similarities without the need for labeled data.

**Question 2:** What is a primary limitation of K-Means clustering?

  A) It can handle very large datasets.
  B) It is sensitive to initial centroids.
  C) It provides clear dendrogram visualizations.
  D) It requires no distance metric.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** K-Means is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids, which can affect the final clustering outcome.

**Question 3:** Which distance metric is most commonly used for clustering numerical data?

  A) Euclidean distance
  B) Cosine similarity
  C) Jaccard index
  D) Hamming distance

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Euclidean distance is the most commonly used metric for clustering numerical data as it measures the straight line distance between two points.

**Question 4:** In the context of clustering, what is the Silhouette Score used for?

  A) To determine the best clustering algorithm
  B) To evaluate the validity of clustering results
  C) To visualize clusters in a dendrogram
  D) To scale data before clustering

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The Silhouette Score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, evaluating the effectiveness of the clustering.

### Activities
- Conduct a group activity where students compare the results of K-Means and Hierarchical clustering on a sample dataset and discuss their findings.
- Create a visual representation (dendrogram) using Hierarchical clustering on a simple dataset and interpret the results in class.

### Discussion Questions
- How does the choice of distance metric impact your clustering results?
- What are some real-world problems that could be solved using clustering that have not been discussed in class?
- How might the presence of outliers affect your clustering outcomes, and what strategies could you employ to mitigate these effects?
