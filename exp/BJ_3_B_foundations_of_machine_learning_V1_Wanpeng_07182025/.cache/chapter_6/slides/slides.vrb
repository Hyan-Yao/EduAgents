\frametitle{Curse of Dimensionality}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        The "curse of dimensionality" describes how adding more dimensions (features) to a dataset renders the distance between data points less meaningful.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clusters can become sparse in high-dimensional spaces.
        \item Distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) may lose effectiveness, leading to misleading results.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In 2 dimensions, points may be easily separated:
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{2D_plot.png} % Placeholder for 2D plot
        \end{center}
        In a 100-dimensional space, points become almost equidistant.
    \end{block}
