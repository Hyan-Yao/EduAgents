Assessment & Evaluation Planning
================================

# Assessment and Evaluation Plan for "Foundations of Machine Learning"

## Overview
The assessment strategy for this course focuses on project-based evaluations that emphasize real-world applications of machine learning concepts. Students will engage in collaborative projects throughout the semester, culminating in a cumulative capstone project instead of a traditional final exam. Milestones will guide their learning and ensure timely progress, while diverse evaluation methods will measure understanding and application.

### **Assessment Components Breakdown**

#### 1. **Class Participation & Engagement (10%)**
- **Format**: Observational assessments during in-class discussions, coding labs, and group activities.
- **Timing**: Ongoing throughout the semester.
- **Submission**: Feedback logged by instructors after each session.
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Active participation, asking questions (3 points)
  - Contribution to group discussions (3 points)
  - Attentiveness and engagement during lectures (4 points)

---

#### 2. **Quizzes & Coding Labs (20%)**
- **Format**: Weekly quizzes (multiple choice and short open-ended questions) and practical coding labs (via Jupyter Notebook in .ipynb format).
- **Timing**: 
  - Quizzes bi-weekly during designated class time.
  - Labs following each relevant topic, due one week after introduction.
- **Submission**: Quizzes via Canvas; coding labs in .ipynb format submitted through Canvas.
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Accuracy in problem-solving (50%)
  - Completeness of solutions (30%)
  - Clarity and organization of code (20%)

---

#### 3. **Midterm Assessment (20%)**
- **Format**: Combination of an open-ended project (individual or pair, requiring a brief written report) and a practical application exam.
- **Timing**: Week 8.
- **Submission**: Project report in .pdf format and code solutions submitted via Canvas.
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Depth of understanding of medium-term concepts (40%)
  - Innovation and creativity in the project (30%)
  - Technical accuracy and execution (20%)
  - Quality of presentation/report (10%)

---

#### 4. **Collaborative Project Work (35%)**
- **Structure**: Three distinct milestones throughout the semester leading to a final project presentation.
- **Format**: 
  - **Milestone 1** - Project Proposal (5%): Description of project scope, dataset, models to be utilized; submitted as a .pdf.
  - **Milestone 2** - Progress Report (10%): Update on project progress including preliminary results and challenges; Group submission in .pdf.
  - **Milestone 3** - Final Presentation (20%): Presentation of findings using slides and a live demo of project outputs (using PowerPoint or similar). Recorded presentations uploaded to Canvas.
- **Timing**: 
  - Proposal due in Week 11.
  - Progress Report due in Week 12.
  - Final Presentation during Week 14. 
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Clarity and feasibility of the proposal (30%)
  - Completeness and depth of the progress report (30%)
  - Quality of final presentation: organization, clarity, engagement (40%)

---

#### 5. **Ethical Evaluation Assignment (15%)**
- **Format**: Group presentation on ethical considerations of machine learning applications. Student groups must select a relevant ethical dilemma, evaluate it, and propose potential mitigation strategies.
- **Timing**: Assignments collected at the end of Week 10.
- **Submission**: Group presentation slides in .pdf format and peer feedback collected through Canvas.
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Depth of ethical analysis (50%)
  - Quality of proposed solutions (30%)
  - Presentation style and engagement (20%)

---

### **Submission Logistics**
- Submit all assignments via the Canvas LMS.
- All coding labs must be in .ipynb format, with clear comments explaining the code.
- Group work submissions should explicitly list group members.
- Late submissions will incur a 10% penalty per day unless prior arrangements are made.

### **Final Cumulative Project**
- As a replacement for a final exam, students will undertake a cumulative project that requires them to apply the skills acquired throughout the course.
- This project encapsulates all elements of machine learning learned, including implementation of algorithms, model evaluation, and ethical considerations.
- Projects can be based on personal interests or real-world applications in their respective fields.

### **Grading Scale**
- A = 90-100%
- B = 80-89%
- C = 70-79%
- D = 60-69%
- F = Below 60%

### **Conclusion**
The above assessment and evaluation plan is designed to ensure that students not only grasp the theoretical knowledge of machine learning but also develop practical skills and an ethical understanding vital for their future careers. Continuous feedback throughout the course will also facilitate learning and support student growth.
