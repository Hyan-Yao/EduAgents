\frametitle{Example of Linear Regression}
    \begin{block}{Example Equation}
        For a simple linear regression with one independent variable:
        \begin{equation}
            Price = 50,000 + 200 \times Size
        \end{equation}
        Here, 50,000 is the intercept, and 200 indicates that for every additional square foot, the price increases by $200.

    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Linear regression is a cornerstone of statistical modeling and machine learning. It provides a straightforward approach for predicting outcomes based on the influence of independent variables.
