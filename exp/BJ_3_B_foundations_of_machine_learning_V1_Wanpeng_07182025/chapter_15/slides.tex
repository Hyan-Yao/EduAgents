    \frametitle{Model Performance Metrics - Overview}
    Analyzing and interpreting model performance is crucial for understanding machine learning algorithms. We will focus on five essential metrics:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Accuracy
        \item Precision
        \item Recall
        \item F1 Score
        \item ROC-AUC
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model Performance Metrics - Accuracy}
    \begin{block}{Accuracy}
        \textbf{Definition}: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
    \end{block}
    \begin{equation}
        \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{True Positives} + \text{True Negatives}}{\text{Total Instances}}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a binary classification problem with 100 total instances, if 80 were correctly classified (60 true positives + 20 true negatives), the accuracy would be 80\%.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model Performance Metrics - Precision and Recall}
    \begin{block}{Precision}
        \textbf{Definition}: The ratio of true positive outcomes to the total predicted positive outcomes. It answers: "Of all predicted positive instances, how many were actually positive?"
        
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}
        \end{equation}
        
        \begin{block}{Example}
            If a model predicts 40 positive instances, of which only 30 are true positives, the precision is 75\%.
        \end{block}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Recall (Sensitivity)}
        \textbf{Definition}: The ratio of true positive outcomes to the actual positive instances. It answers: "Of all actual positive instances, how many did we correctly identify?"
        
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}
        \end{equation}
        
        \begin{block}{Example}
            If there are 50 actual positive instances and the model correctly identifies 30, its recall is 60\%.
        \end{block}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model Performance Metrics - F1 Score and ROC-AUC}
    \begin{block}{F1 Score}
        \textbf{Definition}: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two metrics. Useful when needing balance between precision and recall.
        
        \begin{equation}
            F1 \text{ Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
        \end{equation}
        
        \textbf{Key Point}: A high F1 score indicates a good balance between precision and recall.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{ROC-AUC}
        \textbf{Definition}: A graphical representation of a model's performance by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various thresholds.
        
        \textbf{Key Point}: AUC is particularly useful for binary classification problems with imbalanced datasets. AUC of 0.5 indicates random guessing, while 1.0 indicates perfect classification.
    \end{block}
