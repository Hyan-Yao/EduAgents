Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

### Final Project Plan: Real-World Application of Machine Learning

---

#### Project Description
In lieu of a traditional final exam, students will collaboratively design and implement a machine learning project that simulates a real-world problem-solving scenario. The project will entail the development, evaluation, and ethical considerations of machine learning models while emphasizing teamwork, applied skills, and critical thinking.

---

#### Project Objectives
- Define and describe key machine learning concepts.
- Implement appropriate machine learning algorithms.
- Analyze and interpret results from model performance.
- Critically evaluate the applications and limitations of utilized algorithms.
- Engage in collaborative project work, enhancing teamwork skills.
- Discuss relevant ethical issues in machine learning applications.
- Assess learning progress through project components.
