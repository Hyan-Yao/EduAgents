# Final Project Plan: "Designing and Implementing Scalable Data Processing Workflows"

## Project Description
This project provides students with a hands-on opportunity to design and implement scalable data processing workflows using modern technologies such as Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark. The initiative aligns with real-world data challenges, promoting teamwork, technical skills, and critical thinking throughout the data lifecycle.

## Project Objectives
1. **Understand Data Processing Fundamentals**: Differentiate between batch and stream processing; identify data storage options.
2. **Analyze and Design Data Architectures**: Examine existing architectures and design efficient, scalable solutions.
3. **Implement Data Processing Workflows**: Develop and execute workflows using selected technologies.
4. **Evaluate Data Systems Performance**: Assess and optimize performance for data processing systems.
5. **Integrate APIs for Data Processing**: Showcase methodologies by integrating multiple APIs.
6. **Collaborate in Data Science Teams**: Enhance teamwork and provide constructive peer feedback.
