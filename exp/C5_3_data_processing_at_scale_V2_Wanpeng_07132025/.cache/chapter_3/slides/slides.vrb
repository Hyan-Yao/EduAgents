    \begin{block}{Key Takeaway}
        Scalability in data processing is not just about adding more hardware; itâ€™s about thoughtfully designing systems and architectures that can grow dynamically while maintaining efficiency and performance.

    \begin{block}{Example Formula}
        \textbf{Throughput (T) Calculation:}
        \begin{equation}
          T = \frac{Total\_Processed\_Data}{Time}
        \end{equation}
        Where `Total_Processed_Data` is the amount of data processed and `Time` is the duration of the processing cycle.
