### Refined Course Objectives for "C5_3 Data Processing at Scale"

1. **Understand Data Processing Fundamentals:**
   - Students will articulate the core principles of data processing, distinguishing between batch and stream processing, and identify at least three data storage options along with their specific applications in industry.

2. **Analyze and Design Data Architectures:**
   - Students will analyze three existing data processing architectures and design at least one scalable data processing solution tailored to a given real-world scenario.

3. **Implement Data Processing Workflows:**
   - Students will develop and execute a functioning data processing workflow using Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark, ensuring it meets specified performance criteria.

4. **Evaluate Data Systems Performance:**
   - Students will assess the performance of various data processing systems by applying four key metrics, identify at least two bottlenecks, and propose solutions to improve system efficiency.

5. **Integrate APIs for Data Processing:**
   - Students will demonstrate the integration of a minimum of three APIs in a data processing project, presenting their methodologies and results in a clear report.

6. **Collaborate in Data Science Teams:**
   - Students will work in teams to complete a data processing project, providing peer feedback based on established rubrics to enhance collaboration and reflective practice.
