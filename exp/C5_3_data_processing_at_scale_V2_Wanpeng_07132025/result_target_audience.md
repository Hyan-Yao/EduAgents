Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

### 1) Comprehensive Profile of Target Students

**Typical Background**
- **Academic Background**: Students generally hold a bachelor's degree in computer science, data science, engineering, or statistics, with potential participation from various disciplines such as business. They typically possess foundational knowledge in programming, data structures, and algorithms.
- **Professional Experience**: The audience consists of a mix of individuals with practical experience in roles like data analyst or software developer, alongside students transitioning from other sectors. This diversity indicates different familiarity levels with data processing principles and tools.
- **Career Aspirations**: Students aim for roles including data engineer, data scientist, or technical project manager motivated by industry demand and personal career development.

**Prerequisite Knowledge**
- Prior knowledge of programming in languages like Python, Java, or Scala is crucial, as well as some familiarity with both relational and non-relational databases.
- Basic exposure to statistical analysis techniques and big data technologies (such as Hadoop or Spark) can influence student learning pace and skill acquisition.

**Identified Knowledge Gaps**
- Limited practical experience with distributed computing frameworks may hinder students from executing data workflows effectively.
- Inadequate understanding of system design principles, especially concerning batch vs. stream processing paradigms, often arises from primarily theoretical training.
- Varied exposure to APIs and web technologies may contribute to challenges in real-world application integration.

**Common Challenges**
1. **Technological Fluency**: Disparities in familiarity with essential tools (Hadoop, Spark) and version control systems (Git) can complicate collaborative projects and content engagement.
2. **Conceptual Understanding**: Difficulty in differentiating between data processing paradigms such as batch vs. stream processing is common, especially for students with limited prior exposure.
3. **Collaboration Skills**: Students may face challenges in teamwork due to varying collaboration and communication competencies, leading to potential inequity in group project contributions.

### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Pre-Course Surveys**: Implement surveys to assess students' prior knowledge, pinpoint skill gaps, and tailor content accordingly. This can help initiate a foundational review that aligns all students before diving into complex topics.

2. **Modular Approach**: Structure the curriculum into manageable modules that introduce fundamental concepts first, gradually advancing to complex subjects. This scaffolding allows students to build their understanding and ensures comprehension before progressing.

3. **Practical Applications**: Increase the use of case studies and real-world projects that underscore the importance of concepts in practical settings. This experiential learning approach can enhance theoretical understanding and improve engagement.

4. **Resource Enhancement**: Update and expand course materials to focus on key areas, such as system design and architecture, providing a holistic understanding. Additionally, utilize diverse teaching media (e.g., video tutorials, interactive sessions) to cater to varied learning preferences.

5. **Continuous Feedback Loops**: Establish mechanisms for regular feedback on student understanding and progress. Frequent assessments can inform instructive modifications and empower students to engage in their learning journey actively.

6. **Peer Mentorship**: Develop a mentorship program where more advanced students or teaching assistants provide support to peers who may need additional guidance. This collaboration can enhance the learning experience and foster a sense of community within the course. 

By addressing these recommendations, the course "C5_3 Data Processing at Scale" can be adapted to meet the diverse needs of students effectively, fostering a successful learning environment that prepares them for their future careers.
