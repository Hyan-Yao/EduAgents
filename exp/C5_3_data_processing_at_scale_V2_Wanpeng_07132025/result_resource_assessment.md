Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource & Constraints Assessment for "C5_3 Data Processing at Scale"

## 1. Faculty Expertise Requirements
- **Necessary Expertise**: 
  - In-depth knowledge of data processing technologies: 
    - Apache Hadoop (batch processing)
    - Apache Spark (stream processing)
  - Experience with data architecture design.
  - Proficient in integrating APIs within data workflows.

- **Teaching Credentials**: 
  - Previous experience in teaching data science, project management, and performance evaluation of data systems.
  - Participation in faculty development programs to enhance teaching strategies.

## 2. Necessary Computing Resources
- **Computational Infrastructure**:
  - **Cloud-Based Solutions**: Partnership with providers like AWS or Google Cloud for resourcesâ€”temporary access can allow students to perform workflows without extensive local systems.
  - **Local Cluster Setups**: Establishment of adequate computational resources for executing data processing tasks.

- **Course Materials**:
  - Creation of a repository with accessible, anonymized datasets for practical exercises.
  - Collaboration with data organizations for dataset access or utilization of publicly available datasets.

## 3. Software Requirements
- **Data Processing Frameworks**: 
  - Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark installed on student systems.
  
- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**:
  - Access to IDEs that support languages such as Scala, Java, and Python (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, IntelliJ).
  
- **Version Control Software**:
  - Implementation of Git for project collaboration management.

- **API Testing Tools**:
  - Access to software for API simulation to facilitate practical integration experiences for students.

## 4. Scheduling Constraints
- **Classroom Facilities**:
  - Ensure classroom provisions include computers that support necessary software and reliable internet.
  - Consider virtual lab environments for online class sessions if on-campus facilities are inadequate.

- **Scheduling Conflicts**:
  - Conduct pre-course surveys to gauge student preferences on scheduling to enhance attendance rates.

## 5. Additional Constraints
- **Teaching Assistant Support**:
  - Deployment of a mentorship program leveraging advanced students as peer TAs to assist the instructor and manage larger groups effectively.

- **Platform Policy Constraints**:
  - Consistent engagement with administration to align course delivery with institutional policies, facilitate discussions on grading and assessment methods.

## 6. Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Enhancing Course Materials**: Revamp presentation materials to ensure comprehensive coverage of data system design and architecture.
2. **Real-World Applications**: Incorporate case studies and examples that demonstrate practical applications of data processing techniques.
3. **User-Friendly Design**: Restructure materials for clearer presentation, ensuring prioritization of critical subjects with varied learning mediums.
4. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish continuous feedback opportunities to iterate on course delivery based on student input.

## Conclusion
The assessment of available resources, constraints, and technological requirements highlights the necessity for careful planning and implementation for the successful delivery of "C5_3 Data Processing at Scale." Addressing areas of need and integrating feedback will be crucial in enhancing the learning experience.
