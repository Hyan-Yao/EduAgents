\frametitle{Loss Functions and Optimization - Example}
    \begin{block}{Example Illustration}
        Imagine training a neural network to classify images of cats and dogs. The loss function measures the model's performance by calculating how incorrect its predictions are. As optimization techniques like Adam adjust the model's weights, the loss should decrease over epochs, indicating better learning.
