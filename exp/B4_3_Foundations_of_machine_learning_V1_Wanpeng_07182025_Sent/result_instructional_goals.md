Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

1. **Define and differentiate key machine learning concepts** (e.g., supervised vs. unsupervised learning, types of algorithms) through a quiz or exam.

2. **Implement at least three different machine learning algorithms** using Python and Scikit-learn on a provided dataset, demonstrating proficiency in model validation and performance evaluation.

3. **Prepare a dataset for analysis** through preprocessing techniques (normalization, outlier detection) and validate data quality, providing a detailed report on the steps taken.

4. **Evaluate model performance** using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, applying these metrics to a real-world scenario and interpreting the results in context.

5. **Compose a short paper** discussing the ethical considerations relevant to machine learning applications, incorporating case studies and evaluation criteria to enhance understanding and insight. 

6. **Collaborate effectively in a team project**, utilizing tools for version control, and document methodologies and findings in both written reports and oral presentations.
