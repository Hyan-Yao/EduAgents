Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan for **B4_3 Foundations of Machine Learning**

## Project Description
The final project integrates course learning objectives with real-world problem-solving in machine learning. Students will collaboratively build machine learning models to address specific problems using authentic datasets, analyzing results, and reflecting on the implications of their findings.

## Objectives
- Develop a clear problem statement and methodology relevant to a real-world scenario.
- Apply machine learning algorithms to analyze authentic datasets.
- Evaluate model performance and discuss ethical implications of findings.
- Foster collaboration and analytical thinking within teams.
- Reinforce machine learning concepts through individual assignments.

## Grading Rubric
Each milestone will have specific assessment criteria focusing on clarity, completeness, organization, engagement, and analytical depth. Detailed rubrics will be provided upon assignment distribution.

## Submission Formats
- All documents (proposals and reports) must be submitted in PDF format.
- Individual assignments must be submitted as Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb).
- All submissions will be made through Canvas LMS.

## Academic Integrity Guidelines
- Students must ensure originality in their work and responsible use of datasets.
- Ethical implications of machine learning must be reflected in assignments.
- Strict adherence to academic integrity policies is mandatory, including proper citation and data usage guidelines.

## Real-World Data & Scenarios
Students will select datasets from publicly available sources like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository that address real-world problems in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and industry. 

## Conclusion
The final project is designed to align with course objectives while providing real-world application experiences. It encourages structured learning, collaboration, and critical thinking, preparing students for future careers in data science and machine learning.
