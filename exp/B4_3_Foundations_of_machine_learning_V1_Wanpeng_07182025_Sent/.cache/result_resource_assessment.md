Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: "B4_3_Foundations_of_machine_learning"

## 1. Faculty Expertise Requirements
- **Machine Learning Knowledge**: Instructors must possess a comprehensive understanding of core machine learning concepts, including supervised and unsupervised learning, coupled with hands-on experience using Python and Scikit-learn.
- **Data Preprocessing Skills**: Proficiency in data preprocessing techniques, such as normalization, outlier detection, and transformation is critical.
- **Evaluation Techniques**: Instructors should demonstrate a strong grasp of model evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Faculty should be capable of navigating discussions around the ethical implications tied to machine learning applications.
- **Collaboration Skills**: Familiarity with version control systems and collaborative tools is essential to mentor students effectively during team projects.

### Recommendations
- **Recruitment and Development**: Consider recruiting additional qualified faculty or providing targeted professional development for existing instructors.
- **Ongoing Training**: Encourage faculty to participate in workshops focused on evolving methodologies in machine learning.

## 2. Necessary Computing Resources
- **Hardware Assessment**: An inventory audit of current computing resources is needed to determine compatibility with course demands.
- **High-Performance Computing**: Availability of high-performance computing clusters should be assessed based on the scale of datasets utilized.
- **Cloud Services**: Partner with cloud service providers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) to provide scalable computing resources, reducing on-premises infrastructure reliance.

### Recommendations
- Develop an infrastructure plan considering scalability for fluctuating student enrollment.

## 3. Software Requirements
- **Programming Environment**: Python must be the primary language with Scikit-learn pre-installed.
- **Development Tools**: Provide access to Jupyter Notebooks or alternative interactive IDEs.
- **Version Control Software**: Ensure tools like GitHub are available for collaborative projects.
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: Access to essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and potentially alternative platforms like Google Colab.

### Recommendations
- Verify licensing for required software and plan for installation on all relevant systems or virtual environments.

## 4. Scheduling Constraints
- **Class Timing**: Identify optimal scheduling for lectures and labs that accommodates diverse student availability.
- **Extended Lab Hours**: Coordinate with IT for extended access to lab resources on nights and weekends for group work sessions.

### Recommendations
- Explore offering multiple course sections or flexible scheduling with asynchronous components for broader accessibility.

## 5. Facility Limitations
- **Classroom Technology**: Ensure reliable Wi-Fi and necessary projection equipment are functional for demonstrations and group work.
- **Collaboration Spaces**: Address capacity constraints in classrooms to ensure adequate room for team-based projects.

### Recommendations
- Redesign classroom layouts for flexibility, incorporating movable furniture or breakout areas conducive for collaborative learning.

## 6. Assessing User Feedback
- **Learning Objectives**: Make learning objectives more measurable with concrete criteria for evaluation.
- **Accessibility**: Collaborate with disability services to ensure all materials and resources are accessible to students with special needs.
- **Usability Testing**: Conduct assessments to enhance user experience based on student feedback.

### Recommendations
- Implement usability testing sessions to ascertain clarity and user-friendliness in instructional materials.
