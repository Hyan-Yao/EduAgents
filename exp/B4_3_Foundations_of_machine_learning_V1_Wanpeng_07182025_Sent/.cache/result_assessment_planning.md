Assessment & Evaluation Planning
================================

# Assessment and Evaluation Plan for Course: **B4_3 Foundations of Machine Learning**

## Overview
The assessment strategy emphasizes project-based evaluations that encourage collaboration, practical problem-solving, and critical reflection, replacing traditional exams with structured milestones and a cumulative final project.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Define and differentiate key machine learning concepts (e.g., supervised vs. unsupervised learning).
2. Implement various machine learning algorithms using Python and Scikit-learn.
3. Prepare datasets for analysis using data preprocessing techniques.
4. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
5. Discuss ethical considerations in machine learning applications comprehensively.
6. Collaborate effectively as part of a team project using version control tools.

## Assessment Structure

### 1. Project-Based Evaluations

#### Capstone Project

   - Handling Questions and Feedback (30%)

### Weekly Assignments
- Graded on a scale (0-100) based on:
    - Accuracy of Implementation (40%)
    - Depth of Engagement with Topics (30%)
    - Quality of Code (30%)

## Submission Logistics
- **Format**: 
    - Proposals and reports in PDF format.
