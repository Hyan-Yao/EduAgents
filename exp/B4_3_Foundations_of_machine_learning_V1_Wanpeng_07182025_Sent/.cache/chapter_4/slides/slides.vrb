            \textbf{Feature}                & \textbf{K-Means Clustering}                            & \textbf{Hierarchical Clustering}                \\
            \hline
            Algorithm Type                  & Partitioning method                                    & Agglomerative or Divisive                      \\
            \hline
            Cluster Structure                & Creates non-overlapping partitions                     & Creates a dendrogram (tree structure)          \\
            \hline
            Number of Clusters               & Requires predefined number (K)                        & No need to define initially; can be determined based on the dendrogram \\
            \hline
            Complexity                       & Typically faster, O(n * k * i)                       & More computationally expensive, O(n^3)         \\
            \hline
            Scalability                      & Scales well with large datasets                        & Struggles with large datasets                   \\
            \hline
            Shape of Clusters               & Assumes spherical clusters                             & Can detect complex shapes                       \\
            \hline
            Sensitivity to Outliers          & Very sensitive to outliers                            & More robust, but certain techniques can be affected \\
