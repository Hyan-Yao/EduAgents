    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations in Machine Learning - Introduction}
    The integration of machine learning (ML) into various sectors poses significant ethical considerations that must be addressed to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency. 
    These issues primarily revolve around \textbf{bias} and \textbf{fairness}, which can have profound implications on individuals and communities.

    \frametitle{Understanding Bias in Machine Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: Bias in ML refers to systematic errors that cause certain groups to be disadvantaged or unfairly treated based on demographic factors (e.g., race, gender, age).
        \item \textbf{Types of Bias}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Data Bias}: Occurs when the training dataset does not represent the population adequately.
            \item \textbf{Algorithmic Bias}: Results from the design of algorithms that favor one group over another.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example}: Amazon's hiring algorithm developed a preference for male candidates, reflecting historical hiring biases in the tech industry.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Fairness in Machine Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: Fairness in ML ensures equitable treatment across different demographic groups to mitigate biases.
        \item \textbf{Fairness Approaches}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Disparate Impact}: Ensure outcomes do not disadvantage certain groups based on protected attributes.
            \item \textbf{Equal Opportunity}: Ensure equal chances of favorable outcomes across groups.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Frameworks for Fairness}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Statistical Parity}: Achieve equal acceptance rates across groups.
            \item \textbf{Equalized Odds}: Ensure equal true positive and false positive rates across groups.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Types of Machine Learning}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Supervised Learning}: Learning from labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).
            \item \textit{Unsupervised Learning}: Discovering patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering).
            \item \textit{Reinforcement Learning}: Learning through feedback from actions (e.g., game playing AI).
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Applications of Machine Learning}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Healthcare}: Predictive analytics for patient outcomes.
            \item \textit{Finance}: Fraud detection systems.
            \item \textit{Marketing}: Customer segmentation for targeted ads.
