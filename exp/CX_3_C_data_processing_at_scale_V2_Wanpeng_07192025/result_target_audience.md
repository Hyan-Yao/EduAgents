Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

### 1) Comprehensive Profile of Target Students

**Typical Background:**
- Students come from a mix of academic fields including Computer Science, Data Science, Information Technology, Engineering, business, social sciences, and healthcare.
- Non-technical individuals seeking new skills relevant for career advancement or transitions also enroll.

**Prior Knowledge:**
- Foundational understanding of data concepts, basic programming skills (preferably in Python and SQL), and familiarity with databases are expected.
- Some students may have basic exposure to data analysis but limited hands-on experience with specific tools for data processing.

**Learning Needs:**
- Students require supplemental foundational knowledge in data processing concepts and tools due to varying levels of technical skills.
- Introduction to statistics should be considered vital to facilitate understanding of data analysis.
- A significant number may lack familiarity with data visualization techniques and may require support in this area.
- Ethical considerations surrounding data handling might be new to many students and necessitate thorough contextualization.

**Appropriate Educational Approaches:**
- **Beginner-Friendly Course Design**: Structure should include tiered learning paths, breaking topics into smaller, manageable modules that build on one another.
- **Blended Learning**: A combination of lectures, hands-on labs, and asynchronous resources tailored to studentsâ€™ varied learning styles should be employed.
- **Support Mechanisms**: Introducing teaching assistants, specialized tutorial sessions, and peer discussions would bolster personalized support and enhance student learning experiences.
- **Practical Learning**: Utilizing real-world datasets and project-based assessments will solidify theoretical concepts through practical application.

### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Revise Course Structure**: Create tiered learning paths, emphasizing introductory modules to accommodate beginners while maintaining engagement for advanced learners.
  
2. **Additional Resources**: Offer pre-course workshops or online modules focusing on foundational data processing concepts and statistical knowledge to bridge gaps.
  
3. **Emphasize Hands-On Experience**: Design project-based assessments utilizing real-world datasets to practice ETL processes, allowing students to apply their learning practically.
  
4. **Beginner-Friendly Language**: Rephrase learning objectives using more accessible language, focusing on clarity and relatability to enhance understanding for all students.

5. **Dedicated Visual Learning**: Introduce workshops on data visualization tools, as well as practical application exercises in tools like Tableau or Power BI.

6. **Integrate Ethics and Compliance**: Include contextual case studies along with guest speakers who specialize in data ethics to provide real-world perspectives and enhance comprehension.

7. **Continuous Improvement Mechanism**: Implement anonymous surveys to gather ongoing student feedback, enabling rapid responses to learning challenges encountered during the course.

8. **Encourage Teaching Assistant Involvement**: Establish office hours for teaching assistants to cater specifically to beginner-level queries, promoting a supportive and inclusive environment for all students.
