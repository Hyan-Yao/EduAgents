\frametitle{Utilizing Subqueries - SELECT & INSERT}

    \begin{block}{1. Subqueries in a SELECT Statement}
    Example: Find all employees whose salaries are above the average salary in the company.
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
SELECT employee_id, employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
    \end{lstlisting}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Explanation}
    The inner query calculates the average salary. The outer query retrieves employees with salaries greater than this average.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{2. Subqueries in an INSERT Statement}
    Example: Insert new employees who are in the same department as ‘John Doe’.
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
INSERT INTO employees (employee_name, department_id)
SELECT 'Jane Smith', department_id
FROM employees
WHERE employee_name = 'John Doe';
    \end{lstlisting}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Explanation}
    The subquery retrieves the department ID of 'John Doe', allowing the new employee to be inserted into the correct department.
    \end{block}
