    \frametitle{Key Concepts}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Defining Roles and Responsibilities}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Role clarity is essential: define each member's role to avoid overlap.
            \item Example roles:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Project Manager}: Oversees the project and ensures deadlines are met.
                \item \textbf{Researchers}: Collect relevant information and data.
                \item \textbf{Designers}: Focus on visual aspects of the project.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RACI)}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Responsible (who does the work)
                \item Accountable (who is ultimately accountable)
                \item Consulted (who provides input)
                \item Informed (who is kept updated)
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Creating Timelines}
        \begin{itemize}

    \frametitle{Effective Communication Techniques - Overview}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Effective communication is essential for project success and collaboration.
        \item Key techniques:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Active Listening
            \item Feedback
            \item Conflict Resolution
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Effective Communication Techniques - Active Listening}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Active listening is the practice of fully concentrating, understanding, responding, and remembering what is being said.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Points}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Focus on the speaker: Eliminate distractions and maintain eye contact.
            \item Show that you're listening: Use nonverbal cues (e.g., nodding) and verbal affirmations (e.g., "I see.").
            \item Avoid interrupting: Allow the speaker to finish before responding.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Effective Communication Techniques - Example of Active Listening}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a team meeting, instead of preparing your response while someone is speaking, listen attentively and paraphrase what they said after they finish:
        \begin{quote}
            “So, you’re suggesting that we adjust the timeline?”
        \end{quote}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Effective Communication Techniques - Feedback}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Feedback is information provided regarding a person's performance of a task, aimed at improving future performance.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Points}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Be specific: Instead of "good job," specify what was done well.
            \item Timely: Provide feedback shortly after the event.
            \item Constructive: Balance positive comments with suggestions for improvement.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Effective Communication Techniques - Example of Feedback}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        After presenting a project proposal, a teammate might say:
        \begin{quote}
            “The visuals were compelling, but I think we can clarify the data interpretation to make it more accessible.”
        \end{quote}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Effective Communication Techniques - Conflict Resolution}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Conflict resolution is the process of resolving a dispute by providing an acceptable solution for all parties involved.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Points}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Identify the cause: Understand the root of the conflict.
            \item Communicate openly: Encourage team members to express concerns.
            \item Collaborate on solutions: Aim for a win-win situation.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Effective Communication Techniques - Example of Conflict Resolution}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        If two team members disagree on the project direction, they might:
        \begin{quote}
            "Sit down together to outline their views and negotiate a plan that incorporates both ideas."
        \end{quote}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

        \item \textbf{Identifies Strengths and Weaknesses}: Highlights individual contributions, helping team members understand their impact and areas for improvement.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Common Methods of Peer Evaluation}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Rating Scales}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Description}: Each team member rates their peers on a predetermined scale (e.g., 1-5) based on specific criteria such as contribution, teamwork, and communication.
                \item \textbf{Example}: A form might ask respondents to rate each team member on a scale of 1-5 regarding their reliability and commitment to project deadlines.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{360-Degree Feedback}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Description}: Collecting feedback from all team members, including self-assessments, thereby gathering a comprehensive view of performance.
                \item \textbf{Example}: Team A completes a project, and each member fills out a feedback form assessing themselves and their peers on various competencies, such as leadership and initiative.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Self-Assessment}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Description}: Individuals evaluate their own contributions and performance. This method promotes self-reflection and personal accountability.
                \item \textbf{Example}: Each team member submits a report detailing their own contributions to the project, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Qualitative Feedback}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Description}: Involves open-ended responses where team members provide narrative feedback about each other's contributions, strengths, and areas for improvement.
                \item \textbf{Example}: Team members are asked to write comments about a peer’s performance in areas such as creativity, teamwork, and conflict resolution, leading to richer insights.

    \frametitle{Formula for Effective Peer Evaluation}
    \begin{equation}
    \text{Evaluation Score} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Feedback Score}_i}{n}
    \end{equation}
    \textbf{Where:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( n \) = number of evaluations received.
        \item \( \text{Feedback Score}_i \) = individual ratings of team member's performance.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    By implementing structured peer evaluation methods, teams can significantly enhance their collaborative efforts, promote a positive team culture, and achieve better project outcomes. Use these techniques not just for assessment but as a learning opportunity for all team members.
