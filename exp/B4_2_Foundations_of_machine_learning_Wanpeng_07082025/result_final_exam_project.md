# Final Project Plan Document for B4_2: Foundations of Machine Learning

## Project Title: "Predicting Economic Outcomes with Machine Learning"

### Project Description:
This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict economic outcomes using real-world datasets. Students will collaborate in teams to implement and evaluate various machine learning models, analyze results, and explore the ethical implications of their methodologies.

### Objectives:
- Implement, evaluate, and interpret various machine learning algorithms.
- Analyze and discuss results based on economic datasets.
- Evaluate ethical considerations associated with machine learning techniques.
- Develop collaborative skills through effective teamwork.
