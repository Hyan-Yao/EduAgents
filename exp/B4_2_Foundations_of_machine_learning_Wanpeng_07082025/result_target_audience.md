Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

### 1) Target Student Profile

**Demographics and Background:**
- **Total Students:** Approximately 150
- **Student Level:** Primarily undergraduate students
- **International/Domestic Ratio:** 60% international, 40% domestic
- **Academic Background:** Primarily from Computer Science and engineering disciplines (Electrical and Industrial Engineering).

**Academic Performance:**
- **Overall Academic Strength:** Generally strong foundational knowledge.
- **Undergraduate-Level Readiness:** High readiness anticipated but varies due to exposure to machine learning and assessment practices in the U.S.

**Programming Competency:**
- Confidence in Python programming, essential for practical course components.

**Identified Learning Gaps and Needs:**
1. **Conceptual Gaps:**
   - Lack of familiarity with machine learning fundamentals (e.g., supervised vs. unsupervised learning, neural networks).
  
2. **Mathematical Foundations:**
   - Minor gaps in probability, linear algebra, and optimization; focus on these may be needed.

3. **Tool Proficiency Gaps:**
   - Uneven familiarity with tools (Scikit-learn, Google Colab), necessitating additional support.

4. **Language and Instruction Clarity Needs:**
   - International students may require simplified instructions and more visuals to comprehend complex concepts.

5. **Learning Style Considerations:**
   - Preference for project-based learning emphasizes engaging, collaborative tasks over high-stakes exams.

6. **Pacing Concerns:**
   - Feedback indicates pacing may be rushed; especially affecting those less familiar with tools, necessitating adjustments for foundational concepts.

### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Remedial Sessions on Core Concepts:**
   - Host workshops on machine learning fundamentals and essential maths. Pre-assessment quizzes to gauge understanding should follow.

2. **Tool Proficiency Development:**
   - Offer dedicated training sessions for Scikit-learn and Google Colab. Provide resource guides with examples and tutorial links.

3. **Inclusive Instructional Materials:**
   - Adapt materials with simpler language and visuals. Encourage peer collaboration, pairing experienced students with those needing assistance.

4. **Adjusted Course Pacing:**
   - Implement flexible learning with self-paced materials and in-class reinforcement. Utilize mid-course feedback for pacing adjustments.

5. **Assessment Structure:**
   - Focus on project-based assessments supplemented with formative assessments. Clearly define grading rubrics and course expectations to ease student anxiety. 

By recognizing these gaps and implementing tailored adjustments, the course can be more aligned with studentsâ€™ diverse needs, enhancing their overall learning experience in "B4_2_Foundations of Machine Learning."
