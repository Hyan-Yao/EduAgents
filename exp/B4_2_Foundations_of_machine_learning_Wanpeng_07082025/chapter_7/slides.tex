\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is Reinforcement Learning? - Definition}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. 
        Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled data, RL focuses on learning through trial and error, using feedback from previous actions to inform future decisions.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is Reinforcement Learning? - Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Agent}: The learner or decision maker that interacts with the environment.
        \item \textbf{Environment}: The setting or context in which the agent operates, including everything the agent can interact with.
        \item \textbf{Actions}: The set of all possible moves the agent can make.
        \item \textbf{States}: A representation of the current situation of the agent within the environment.
        \item \textbf{Reward}: A feedback signal received after performing an action, guiding the agent on how good or bad the action was.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is Reinforcement Learning? - Significance}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Autonomous Learning}: RL enables machines to learn tasks independently without explicit programming, suitable for complex decision-making scenarios.
        \item \textbf{Versatility}: Applications range from robotics and self-driving cars to game playing (like AlphaGo) and personalized recommendations.
        \item \textbf{Adaptive Behavior}: RL systems can adapt to changing environments, optimizing strategies based on various reward structures over time.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is Reinforcement Learning? - Example and Key Points}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Imagine training a dog to fetch a ball:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Agent}: The dog
            \item \textbf{Environment}: The park where the dog plays
            \item \textbf{Action}: Running to retrieve the ball
            \item \textbf{State}: The position of the dog (e.g., in front of the ball)
            \item \textbf{Reward}: Receiving treats or praise for fetching; no reward if the dog fails to fetch.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Remember}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item RL is about learning from interaction and adjusting strategies based on feedback.
            \item The objective is to develop a policy that maximizes expected rewards over time.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is Reinforcement Learning? - Formula and Conclusion}
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        The Expected Cumulative Reward (Return) can be represented mathematically as:
        \[
        G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \ldots
        \]
        where \(\gamma\) is the discount factor.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Reinforcement Learning is a powerful paradigm in machine learning that emphasizes learning through experience and rewards, enabling a diverse range of applications and fostering autonomy in decision-making systems.

  \frametitle{Key Components of Reinforcement Learning - Agents}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Definition}: 
    An agent is the learner or decision maker in a reinforcement learning framework. It interacts with the environment to achieve specific goals.
    
    \item \textbf{Example}:
    In a game of chess, the player (agent) decides which moves to make.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Components of Reinforcement Learning - Environments, States, Actions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Environments}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Definition}: The environment encompasses everything the agent interacts with, providing feedback based on actions.
      \item \textbf{Example}: In chess, the board and pieces are the environment, which changes with each move by the agent.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{States}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Definition}: A state is a specific configuration of the environment at a given time, guiding the agent's decisions.
      \item \textbf{Example}: In chess, a state represents the arrangement of all pieces at any game point.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Actions}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Definition}: An action is a choice by the agent that alters the environment's state, typically from a finite set of options.
      \item \textbf{Example}: In chess, actions could be moving a pawn, knight, or other pieces.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Components of Reinforcement Learning - Rewards, Summary, and Formula}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rewards}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Definition}: Rewards are signals from the environment regarding the agent's actions, assessing performance against goals.
      \item \textbf{Example}: Winning a chess game could yield a reward of +1, while losing results in -1.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Key Points}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Interconnectedness: Components are interdependent; actions lead to state changes, which impact rewards influencing future actions.
      \item Goal-Oriented Learning: The objective is to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Formula for Cumulative Reward}:
    \begin{equation}
      R = \sum_{t=0}^{T} r_t
    \end{equation}
    Where \( r_t \) = reward at time \( t \), and \( T \) = total number of time steps.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Example Interaction in Reinforcement Learning}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Example of Interaction}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Agent}: Chess player (AI)
      \item \textbf{Environment}: Chessboard
      \item \textbf{State}: Current arrangement of pieces
      \item \textbf{Action}: Move a piece from one position to another
      \item \textbf{Reward}: Score based on win, loss, or draw outcome
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Code Snippet}:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def choose_action(state):
    if explore_probability > random.random():
        return random_action()
    else:
        return best_action(state)
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    This illustrates how an agent may choose between exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known favorable actions).
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Reinforcement Learning Algorithms}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework for developing intelligent agents that learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environment. In this presentation, we will explore three popular RL algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Policy Gradients.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Q-Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} A value-based algorithm that learns the value of an action in a particular state. The agent maintains a table (Q-table) where each entry represents the expected utility (reward) of taking an action from a given state.
        
        \item \textbf{Key Formula:}
        \begin{equation}
            Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_a Q(s', a) - Q(s, a) \right]
        \end{equation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Where:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $Q(s, a)$ = current value of action $a$ in state $s$
                \item $\alpha$ = learning rate ($0 < \alpha \leq 1$)
                \item $r$ = reward received after taking action $a$
                \item $\gamma$ = discount factor ($0 \leq \gamma < 1$)
                \item $s'$ = new state after action $a$
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Example:} In a simple grid world, an agent learns the best path to a goal by updating its Q-table based on rewards received from each action taken.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Policy Gradients}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Deep Q-Networks (DQN):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} An extension of Q-learning that uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function instead of maintaining a Q-table. 
            \item \textbf{Key Points:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Combines Q-learning with deep learning techniques.
                \item Uses experience replay to store previous experiences, improving learning efficiency.
                \item Implements target networks to stabilize training by updating Q-values less frequently.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Example:} DQNs have been successfully used in playing video games like Atari, where the network learns to evaluate the best actions based on visual input rather than discrete states.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Policy Gradients:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} A family of algorithms that optimize the policy directly instead of estimating the value function. The policy is a probability distribution over actions given a state.
            \item \textbf{Key Formula:}
            \begin{equation}
                J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} r_t \right]
            \end{equation}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Where:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item $J(\theta)$ = expected return for the policy parameterized by $\theta$
                    \item $\tau$ = trajectory followed by the agent
                    \item $r_t$ = reward at time step $t$
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Example:} In robotics, policy gradient methods can train a robot to complete tasks through trial and error by continuously updating its approach based on the effectiveness of actions taken.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points and Visual Aids}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Emphasis:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Q-Learning and DQN excel in environments with discrete action spaces.
            \item Policy Gradients are suitable for complex or high-dimensional action spaces.
            \item Q-learning and DQN focus on value estimation, whereas policy gradients directly parameterize the policy.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Visual Aids:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Include a diagram illustrating the flow of Q-learning: State → Action → Reward → Update Q-table for Q-learning.
            \item A simple representation of a neural network used in DQNs.
            \item Visualize policy gradients with a diagram showing the probability distribution of actions in a state space.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
