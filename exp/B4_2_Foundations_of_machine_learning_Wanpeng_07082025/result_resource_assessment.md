   - Understanding of the ethical implications of AI.  

2. **Teaching Experience**:  
   - Experience in delivering complex topics clearly and engagingly, especially in lab environments.  
   - Ongoing professional development opportunities, including workshops or conferences on machine learning advancements.  
   - Consideration for guest lecturers from industry to diversify learning experiences.

### Necessary Computing Resources
1. **Hardware Requirements**:  
   - Classrooms need sufficient computational power for live demonstrations.  
   - High-performance computing resources required for advanced topics (e.g., deep learning).  

2. **Software Requirements**:  
   - Access to Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab for programming assignments.  
   - Required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, ML libraries) to be installed and compatible.  
   - Compliance with institutional LMS policies for assessment and submission platforms (e.g., Canvas).  

3. **Cloud-Based Resources**:  
   - Utilization of cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud) for computational demands, reducing hardware constraints in classrooms.  
   - Confirmation of licensing costs for required software tools; preference for free or open-source options.

### TA Support Availability
1. **TA Role**:  
   - One TA available for programming support and office hours.
   - Office hours scheduled for Monday and Friday, with flexibility for additional appointments.   

2. **Training for TAs**:  
   - Provision of training on course tools and libraries for effective student assistance.  

3. **Student Feedback Loop**:  
   - Mechanisms to gather student feedback on TA support for continuous improvement of assistance.

### Scheduling Constraints
1. **Session Duration**:  
   - Each session lasting 75 minutes requires careful pacing to fit all content and interactive elements.  

2. **In-person Delivery**:  
   - Must secure physical classroom space to meet technology and capacity requirements.  
   - Synchronization of scheduling with surrounding courses to minimize student conflicts.

3. **Flexible Learning Options**:  
   - Possibility of hybrid components to allow for recorded lectures or asynchronous materials.

### Facility Limitations
1. **Classroom Setup**:  
   - Classrooms should have interactive engagement capabilities with adequate power outlets and projectors for demonstrations.  
   - Sufficient internet connectivity for simultaneous student access to resources.

2. **Physical Mobility & Accessibility**:  
   - Review classroom accessibility aligned with ADA standards to accommodate all students.

### Policy Compliance
1. **Submission Formats**:  
   - Ensure students submit assignments in required formats (.pdf and .ipynb) as per policy guidelines.  

2. **Institutional Standards**:  
   - Awareness and communication of ASUâ€™s Academic Integrity Policy, accessibility standards, and copyright guidelines.

3. **Proactive Academic Integrity Education**:  
   - Introduce modules on academic integrity related to machine learning at course initiation.

### Additional Considerations
1. **Course Materials**:  
   - Clear articulation of instructional materials, learning outcomes, grading policies, and weekly outlines.  

2. **Assessment Components**:  
   - Regular evaluations and a final group project necessitate comprehensive collaboration and management support.

3. **Collaborative Tools**:  
   - Utilization of platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams for student collaboration during group projects.  

4. **Assessment Transparency**:  
   - Consistent communication of grading rubrics and expectations to students to prevent misunderstandings.

5. **Real-World Application Focus**:  
   - Incorporation of case studies and industry examples to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application.  

### Conclusion
By comprehensively assessing available resources, constraints, and technological requirements, the course "B4_2_Foundations of Machine Learning" can be effectively structured to foster a high-quality educational environment. Meticulous planning and coordination among faculty, TA, and administrative resources will ensure optimal student learning outcomes in this evolving technological landscape.
