- Encourage student engagement and clarification of concepts.
- Promote critical thinking and discussion around the chapter material.
- Enhance understanding of practical applications of neural networks.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What function is commonly used as an activation function in neural networks?

  A) ReLU
  B) Linear
  C) Quadratic
  D) Constant

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is a widely used activation function that introduces non-linearity into the model.

**Question 2:** What is the main purpose of backpropagation in neural networks?

  A) To generate data
  B) To adjust weights and minimize loss
  C) To initialize the network
  D) To create the architecture

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Backpropagation is used to adjust the weights of the network to minimize the loss function, allowing the model to learn from the data.

**Question 3:** Which of the following is a technique used to prevent overfitting?

  A) Increasing the number of neurons
  B) Reducing the dataset size
  C) Applying dropout
  D) Using a linear activation function

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Applying dropout is a regularization technique that helps to prevent overfitting by randomly omitting a fraction of neurons during training.

**Question 4:** In deep learning, what is the primary distinction from traditional machine learning?

  A) Use of decision trees
  B) Ability to handle high-dimensional data with multiple layers
  C) Focus on linear models
  D) Execution time

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Deep learning leverages multiple layers in neural networks to process high-dimensional data more accurately compared to traditional machine learning.
