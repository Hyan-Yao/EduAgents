**Explanation:** Imputation is a technique used to fill in missing values in datasets, making it a critical step in data preprocessing.

**Question 3:** Why is encoding categorical variables important in machine learning?

  A) Categorical variables can be directly used by models
  B) Categorical variables must be transformed into numerical values
  C) It makes the dataset larger
  D) It automatically eliminates outliers

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Categorical variables need to be converted into numerical formats to enable machine learning models to interpret them effectively.

**Question 4:** How does standardization of data affect machine learning models?

  A) It makes data visualization easier
  B) It prevents models from underfitting
  C) It helps models learn better with features on different scales
  D) It increases dataset size

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Standardization helps in scaling the features so that the model can learn better, especially when features have different value ranges.

### Activities
- Perform a small project where you preprocess a dataset of your choice. Document the steps you take, including feature selection, handling missing values, and any transformations applied.
- Using a dataset, apply one-hot encoding to a categorical feature and compare model performance before and after this preprocessing step.

### Discussion Questions
- What challenges have you faced when preprocessing data in your projects?
- Discuss an example where data preprocessing significantly influenced your machine learning model's performance.
