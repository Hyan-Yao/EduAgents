### Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to data mining principles and techniques. Students will learn to apply various algorithms and analytical methods to real-world data sets, evaluate their effectiveness, and present findings with an emphasis on real-world applications across different industries.

### Course Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. **Articulate Key Principles:** Understand and articulate core data mining concepts, including classification, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, clustering, regression analysis, and model evaluation.
2. **Apply Algorithms:** Implement classification algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbors, to solve practical problems and interpret results accurately.
3. **Evaluate Techniques:** Critically assess the effectiveness of different data mining methodologies concerning accuracy, interpretability, computational efficiency, and industry trends through project scenarios.
4. **Utilize Tools:** Demonstrate proficiency in data mining tools (e.g., Python, R, WEKA) for data cleaning, preprocessing, modeling, and execution of data mining tasks.
5. **Collaborate on Projects:** Work effectively within teams to complete a comprehensive data mining project encompassing problem identification, data collection, analysis, and presentation of findings, with ethical considerations incorporated throughout the project.
6. **Reflect on Learning:** Engage in structured reflective practices to assess personal learning progress throughout the course, utilizing feedback for continuous improvement.
