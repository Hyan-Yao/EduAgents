Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

1. Understand and articulate key data mining principles, including classification, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, clustering methods, regression analysis, and model evaluation.

2. Apply specific classification algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbors, to solve real-world data problems and effectively interpret the results.

3. Critically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different data mining techniques in varying scenarios, with attention to accuracy, interpretability, computational efficiency, and current industry trends.

4. Demonstrate proficiency in using programming languages and software tools (e.g., Python, R, WEKA) for data cleaning, preprocessing, modeling, and executing data mining tasks.

5. Collaborate in teams to complete a comprehensive data mining project that encompasses problem identification, data collection, analysis, and presentation of findings, while adhering to industry best practices and ethical considerations.

6. Engage in reflective practices by assessing personal understanding of the learning objectives throughout the course and leveraging feedback for continuous improvement.
