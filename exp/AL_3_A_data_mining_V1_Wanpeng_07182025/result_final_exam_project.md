# Final Project Plan: Real-World Data Mining Project: An Exploratory Analysis

## Project Description
The Real-World Data Mining Project aims to provide students with a comprehensive, collaborative learning experience that simulates real-world data mining scenarios. Groups will analyze a dataset of their choice or one provided by the instructor, demonstrating their understanding of data mining principles and techniques.

## Objectives
1. Identify and articulate a relevant research question based on a selected dataset.
2. Employ appropriate data mining techniques and algorithms.
3. Analyze and interpret data effectively.
4. Present findings clearly and professionally.
5. Integrate ethical considerations into data practices.

## Timeline with Milestones
- **Week 5: Milestone 1 - Proposal Due**
  - Submit project proposal including research question, dataset justification, and techniques.

- **Week 10: Milestone 2 - Progress Report Due**
  - Submit progress report detailing findings, challenges, and next steps.

- **Week 15: Milestone 3 - Final Deliverable Due**
  - Submit comprehensive report and presentation.

## Deliverables
1. **Proposal** (Due Week 5)
   - PDF document submitted on Canvas.
   
2. **Progress Report** (Due Week 10)
