    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(Y\) = dependent variable (the predicted outcome)
        \item \(a\) = intercept
        \item \(b\) = coefficient (the slope of the line)
        \item \(X\) = independent variable (the predictor)

    \begin{block}{Supervised Learning}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: A method where the model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs).
            \item \textbf{Example}: Predicting house prices based on features such as size, location, and the number of bedrooms.
            \item \textbf{Key Points}:

        \item \textbf{Key Points}: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item No prior labels are required.
            \item Popular clustering algorithms include K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.

    \frametitle{Classification Algorithms}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Classification is a key task in data mining that involves predicting the category (class label) of new observations based on past observations with known labels. Here, we focus on three popular classification algorithms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Decision Trees
            \item Support Vector Machines (SVM)
            \item k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Decision Trees}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like structure that recursively splits the data into subsets based on input features.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Internal nodes represent features.
        \item Branches represent decision rules.
        \item Leaf nodes represent class labels.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Algorithm Steps}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Select a feature that best separates the classes (using metrics like Gini impurity or Information Gain).
            \item Split the data into subsets based on the chosen feature.
            \item Repeat until stopping criteria are met (e.g., all samples in a leaf belong to the same class).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\small]
# Pseudocode for building a Decision Tree
function build_tree(data):
    if stopping_criteria_met(data):
        return create_leaf(data)
    best_feature = select_best_feature(data)
    subsets = split_data(data, best_feature)
    for subset in subsets:
        child_node = build_tree(subset)

    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Support Vector Machines (SVM)}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        SVM is a powerful classification method that finds a hyperplane which best separates the classes in a high-dimensional space, aiming to maximize the margin between different classes.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Works well on both linear and non-linear data.
        \item Uses the kernel trick to transform data into higher dimensions.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        The decision boundary in SVM can be defined as:
        \[
        w \cdot x + b = 0
        \]
        where \( w \) is the weight vector, \( x \) is the input feature vector, and \( b \) is a bias.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        k-NN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Algorithm Steps}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Choose the number of neighbors \( k \).
            \item Compute the distance to all training samples.
            \item Identify the k closest samples and determine their class.
            \item Assign the most common class among the neighbors to the input.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\small]
# Pseudocode for k-NN Classification
function knn_predict(new_point, dataset, k):
    distances = calculate_distances(new_point, dataset)
    neighbors = get_k_nearest_neighbors(distances, k)
    return majority_vote(neighbors)
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Key Points and Conclusion}

        \item \textbf{Applicability}: Each of these algorithms is suited for different contexts based on the nature of the data.
        \item \textbf{Understanding the Basics}: An understanding of how these algorithms process data is crucial.
        \item \textbf{Real-World Applications}: These algorithms are widely used in finance, healthcare, and marketing.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Data Mining Techniques}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Data mining involves extracting valuable insights from large datasets. In this session, we will explore two fundamental methodologies in data mining: \textbf{Regression Analysis} and \textbf{Clustering Methods}. Both techniques help in understanding data patterns, but they serve different purposes and are applied in different contexts.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Regression Analysis}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It's primarily predictive in nature.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Types of Regression}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Linear Regression}: Models the relationship by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
            \item \textbf{Multiple Regression}: Involves two or more independent variables predicting the dependent variable.
            \item \textbf{Logistic Regression}: Used when the dependent variable is categorical (e.g., yes/no outcomes).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Suppose you want to predict housing prices based on various factors such as size, location, and number of bedrooms. A linear regression model could help you understand how these factors impact the price.

    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Common Clustering Algorithms}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{K-Means Clustering}: Partitions data into $k$ clusters by assigning each data point to the nearest cluster center.
            \item \textbf{Hierarchical Clustering}: Builds a tree of clusters either successively merging smaller clusters into larger ones (agglomerative) or dividing larger clusters into smaller ones (divisive).
        \end{itemize}
