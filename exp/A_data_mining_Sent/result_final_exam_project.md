# Final Project Plan: Data Mining and Real-World Applications - "Data-Driven Decision Making"

## Project Overview:
Students will collaboratively choose a real-world dataset and utilize data mining techniques to derive insights and make recommendations. This project will simulate authentic scenarios where data-driven decision-making is crucial, such as predicting health outcomes, analyzing consumer behavior, or enhancing operational efficiencies in a business setting.

## Objectives:
1. Articulate core data mining principles and their applications.
2. Preprocess datasets using techniques such as cleaning, normalization, and transformation.
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) through statistical tools and visualization techniques.
4. Explain and apply various data mining algorithms.
5. Construct, evaluate, and fine-tune predictive models.
6. Identify ethical and legal considerations related to data mining.
7. Communicate insights effectively to technical and non-technical stakeholders.
8. Collaborate on real-world data mining challenges.
