### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** Which metric indicates how often items appear together in transactions?

  A) Confidence
  B) Support
  C) Lift
  D) Total Transactions

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Support measures the frequency of itemsets occurring in the dataset.

**Question 2:** What does the confidence metric represent in association rule mining?

  A) The proportion of transactions that contain a specific itemset.
  B) The likelihood that items appear together in transactions.
  C) The strength of association between two items.
  D) The total number of transactions.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Confidence assesses how often items in a rule appear together relative to the transactions containing the antecedent.

**Question 3:** If the lift value of a rule is less than 1, what does it signify?

  A) Strong positive association
  B) Weak positive association
  C) No association
  D) Strong negative correlation

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** A lift value less than 1 indicates that the items are less likely to be purchased together than by chance, suggesting no strong association.

**Question 4:** What is the formula used to calculate support?

  A) Support(A → B) = Support(A ∩ B) / Support(B)
  B) Support(A) = Number of transactions containing A / Total number of transactions
  C) Confidence(A → B) = Support(A ∩ B) / Support(A)
  D) Lift(A → B) = Confidence(A → B) / Support(B)

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Support is calculated by dividing the number of transactions that contain the itemset by the total number of transactions.
