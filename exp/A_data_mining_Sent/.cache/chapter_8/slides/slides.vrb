\frametitle{Precision - Key Points & Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item High precision means fewer false positives; however, it might come at the cost of lower recall (which measures the ability to capture true positives).
        \item Particularly significant in domains where false positives may incur significant costs.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Conclusion:}
    Precision is crucial in model evaluation, providing insights into the quality of predictions. Balancing precision with other metrics, such as recall, enables a comprehensive view of model performance.
