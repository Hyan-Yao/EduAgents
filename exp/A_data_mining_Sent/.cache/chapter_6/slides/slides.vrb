    \begin{block}{Key Formulas}
        \textbf{Simple Linear Regression Equation:}
        \begin{equation}
            Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon
        \end{equation}
        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $Y$ = dependent variable,
            \item $X$ = independent variable,
            \item $\beta_0$ = intercept,
            \item $\beta_1$ = slope of the line,
            \item $\epsilon$ = error term.
        \end{itemize}
