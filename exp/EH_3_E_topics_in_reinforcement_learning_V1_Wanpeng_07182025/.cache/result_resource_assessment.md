Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

### Resource & Constraints Assessment for Delivering the Course on Topics in Reinforcement Learning (EH_3_E)

#### Faculty Expertise Requirements
1. **Instructor Qualifications**: 
   - Advanced knowledge in machine learning with a strong emphasis on reinforcement learning. Must demonstrate expertise in algorithm development, implementation, and assessment.
   - Proficiency in Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, along with familiarity with other machine learning frameworks and libraries for practical engagement.

2. **Support Personnel**: 
   - Collaborate with guest lecturers for insights on specialized topics or current research in reinforcement learning.
   - Teaching Assistants (TAs) should possess programming skills and be equipped to assist students with coding assignments and facilitate conceptual discussions.

#### Necessary Computing Resources
1. **Hardware**: 
   - Access to computational resources with devices equipped with GPUs or cloud computing services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for executing intensive deep learning models. Important for practical sessions involving algorithm experimentation.

2. **Software**: 
   - Essential setups include environments like Jupyter Notebooks or integrated development environments (IDEs) for Python coding execution.
   - Libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenAI Gym must be readily available, with clear licensing and installation processes for seamless student access.

#### Scheduling Constraints
1. **Course Timing**: 
   - Schedule must be planned to avoid conflicts with prerequisite courses and align with the academic calendar, ideally during a semester when students are best prepared for complex topics in reinforcement learning.

2. **Class Size and Format**: 
   - Evaluate ideal class size for fostering interaction, with a smaller class size (10-20 students) preferred for hands-on coding and individualized support.
   - Determine the delivery mode of the course (face-to-face, online, or hybrid) to appropriately allocate computing resources and engagement strategies.

#### Facility Limitations
1. **Classroom Space**: 
   - Ensure in-person session classrooms are equipped with necessary technology, such as interactive screens, power outlets for laptops, and suitable seating for collaborative work.

2. **Remote Learning Infrastructure**: 
   - Establish robust virtual setups for synchronous and asynchronous learning, accommodating potential time zone differences among remote students, utilizing LMS platforms that support coding tasks and live engagement.

#### Additional Considerations
1. **Learning Outcomes**: 
   - Review and refine learning objectives for clarity and measurability, ensuring alignment with assessment methodologies and real-world applications.

2. **Syllabus Compliance**: 
   - Align the syllabus with institutional requirements, maintaining accessibility standards and clear policies on attendance, grading, and academic integrity for transparency.

3. **TA Support**: 
   - Confirm the schedule and availability of TAs to match class timing. Training TAs on course content and instructional methodologies will be crucial for consistent student support.

### Conclusion
The delivery of the course on Topics in Reinforcement Learning requires careful alignment of faculty expertise, computing and software resources, and the management of scheduling and facility limitations. A comprehensive assessment of these factors is essential to mitigate any constraints that may impact course delivery, ensuring a successful educational experience through continuous collaboration with faculty and administrative units. Ongoing engagement with IT support regarding software installation and resource availability is also critical during the preparation phase.
