**Slide 1: Introduction to Current Research in Reinforcement Learning**

*Start by making eye contact with the audience as you begin your introduction.*

“Welcome everyone to today's deep dive into current research in reinforcement learning. As you may know, reinforcement learning, or RL, is a fascinating area of artificial intelligence that focuses on how agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. Today, we’ll explore recent advancements and key trends that are reshaping the field of RL. 

*Pause for effect.*

Let’s begin our journey by looking at some of the key areas of current research in reinforcement learning.”

*Transition to Frame 2.*

---

**Slide 2: Key Areas of Current Research**

“As we navigate the landscape of reinforcement learning, it’s crucial to highlight several important areas where researchers are making strides. These include scalability and sample efficiency, hierarchical reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning, the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, and transfer learning along with meta-learning. 

*Pause briefly to allow the audience to digest this information.*

Each of these areas represents unique challenges and opportunities. Let’s delve into them one by one, starting with scalability and sample efficiency.”

*Transition to Frame 3.*

---

**Slide 3: Scalability and Sample Efficiency**

“In the realm of RL, scalability and sample efficiency are pivotal. We are witnessing a thrust towards developing algorithms that can learn effectively with fewer interactions with their environments. But why is this important? Well, in many real-world applications—like robotics or healthcare—collecting data can be incredibly costly or even impractical.

For instance, consider model-based reinforcement learning. These algorithms have become popular because they create a model of the environment in which the agent operates. This allows the agent to anticipate the outcomes of its actions, thus requiring fewer actual samples to achieve optimal performance. Imagine having a soccer player who can analyze the field and predict the course of each play before it even happens! This is the potential that model-based approaches offer.”

*Transition to Frame 4.*

---

**Slide 4: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning**

“Now, let’s move on to hierarchical reinforcement learning, which introduces a structured approach to tackling complexity. Here, we organize the learning process into hierarchies of sub-tasks. 

Consider a robot designed for cleaning a room. If we assign it the high-level goal of 'cleaning the room,' it could break that task into more manageable sub-goals, such as 'picking up trash' and 'vacuuming the floor.' 

*Pause and engage the audience with a question.* 

Have any of you ever faced a complex project and found it easier to break it down into smaller tasks? This is essentially what hierarchical reinforcement learning achieves, allowing for quicker learning and more efficient completion of tasks!”

*Transition to Frame 5.*

---

**Slide 5: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**

“Next, we come to deep reinforcement learning, or DRL. This area fuses deep learning techniques with reinforcement learning concepts, enabling agents to handle high-dimensional state spaces, such as images or complex sensory inputs. 

A striking example of DRL in action is AlphaGo, which famously defeated the world champion in the game of Go. AlphaGo employed DRL methods alongside Monte Carlo Tree Search, showcasing how deep learning can simplify the challenges that were once deemed too complex for RL algorithms. 

*Encourage engagement by asking,* 

How many of you have played strategy games? Imagine an AI opponent that learns your strategies and continuously adapts. This is the power of deep reinforcement learning in action!”

*Transition to Frame 6.*

**Slide 6: Exploration vs. Exploitation**

“Now, let’s discuss one of the most critical concepts in RL: the balance between exploration and exploitation. Put simply, exploration involves trying out new actions to discover potential rewards, while exploitation is about utilizing known actions that yield high rewards.

This balance is crucial because, without effective exploration, agents may fail to discover better strategies. Recent advances include techniques like curiosity-driven exploration, which grants rewards for discovering previously unknown states. This approach can significantly enhance performance in sparse-reward environments, where feedback is minimal. 

*Pose a rhetorical question:* 

Isn’t it fascinating that sometimes just being curious can lead to greater achievements?”

*Transition to Frame 7.*

---

**Slide 7: Transfer Learning and Meta-Learning**

“Now, we turn our attention to transfer learning and meta-learning. These concepts offer transformative possibilities for RL. 

Transfer learning allows an agent to apply knowledge from one task to a different but related one. Meanwhile, meta-learning—often called 'learning to learn'—enables agents to adapt quickly to new situations based on past experiences. 

For example, if an RL agent has been trained to play basketball in one game, it can leverage that learning in a similar game, enhancing learning efficiency and reducing the time required for training. 

*Engage the audience with another question:* 

Have you ever switched from one skill, like playing one sport, to another and found that some skills transfer over? That's the essence of transfer learning!”

*Transition to Frame 8.*

**Slide 8: Mathematical Foundations**

“Now, let’s take a look at some foundational mathematics underlying these concepts with the basic RL update rule.

*Point to the equation on the slide.*

This equation updates the action-value function \( Q(s, a) \), which estimates the value of taking action \( a \) in a state \( s \). Parameters like the learning rate \( \alpha \) and discount factor \( \gamma \) play critical roles in how the agent learns from its environment.

*Pause to ensure the audience understands this fundamental aspect of RL.*

Understanding these mathematical foundations is essential as they provide the framework behind how RL algorithms operate.”

*Transition to Frame 9.*

"Now that we've established a foundation for our discussion, let’s delve into the learning objectives for today’s session in reinforcement learning. By the end of this lecture, you should not only understand important concepts but also be aware of the latest advancements in the field."

---

**Frame 1: Overview Frame**

"To begin with, let’s outline the primary learning objectives of the course. The following are the key areas we will focus on:

1. **Understand the fundamentals of reinforcement learning (RL)**: We’ll break down the basics and ensure a solid grasp of RL concepts.
2. **Explore advanced techniques in current research**: This includes recognizing innovative methodologies that are shaping the future of RL.

4. **Apply mathematical concepts and code implementation**: This is where theory meets practice, ensuring you can execute RL strategies effectively.

These objectives will guide our exploration of the field today."

---

**Frame 2: Fundamentals of RL**

"Let’s move on to the first objective: understanding the fundamentals of reinforcement learning. 

**What exactly is reinforcement learning?** 
At its core, reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment** to maximize a cumulative reward. 

Let’s break down a few of the key concepts we’ll encounter:
- **Agent**: This is our decision maker, the entity that takes actions based on certain inputs.
- **Environment**: This represents the context or the world in which our agent operates. It’s vital for establishing how our agent can observe and take action.
- **Action (A)**: These are the choices or moves made by the agent in the environment.
- **State (S)**: This indicates the current situation of the agent within the environment.
- **Reward (R)**: The feedback our environment provides to the agent based on its previous actions. 

For example, consider a game-playing agent learning to play chess. Here, the chessboard acts as the environment, each move constitutes an action, the setup of pieces represents the state, and winning the game can be viewed as receiving a reward.

**Engagement Question**: Have you ever wondered how agents learn to play complex games like chess without any prior knowledge? This is precisely the fascinating process we are dissecting in reinforcement learning."

---

**Frame 3: Advanced Techniques in Current Research**

"Now let’s transition to our second objective: exploring advanced techniques currently making waves in reinforcement learning research.

Two notable developments are:
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: This technique merges traditional RL with deep learning, enabling agents to process large sets of inputs or states, such as images in gaming scenarios or complex data in robotics.
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**: This area investigates how multiple agents can learn simultaneously in shared environments. This can lead to complex dynamics of cooperation or competition, akin to players in a multi-player game scenario.

**Connect to Current Content**: As we witness more complexity in real-world applications, it becomes essential to grasp these advanced methods. Without a doubt, they are laying the groundwork for future innovations.

**Engagement Point**: Have any of you had experience with agents learning in group settings? How do you think that influences their decision-making?"

---

**Frame 4: Mathematical Foundations**

"Next, let’s delve into the mathematical concepts and code implementation of reinforcement learning as outlined in our fourth objective.

It’s critical to understand foundational equations that form the backbone of RL strategies. One of the most important is the **Bellman Equation**, which relates the value of a state to the values of subsequent states. The equation can be expressed as:

\[
V(s) = R(s) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a)V(s')
\]

Here, \( \gamma \) is the discount factor that determines the value of future rewards, and \( P \) is the probability of transitioning to a new state. 

**Real-World Application**: This equation is instrumental in developing algorithms that enable our agents to learn the optimal policy in various environments.

In practical terms, we can see how this works with the following example of a simple Python function that implements the Bellman update process:

```python
import numpy as np

def bellman_update(V, R, P, gamma):
    return R + gamma * np.dot(P, V)
```

**Rhetorical Question**: Have you ever considered how these mathematical principles translate into the algorithms that drive real-world applications? Understanding this connection will empower you to tackle RL problems more proficiently.

---

**Conclusion & Transition to Next Slide**:

"In summary, by the end of this chapter, you will be equipped to critically analyze ongoing research trends in reinforcement learning and apply foundational concepts effectively in practical scenarios.

Let’s now proceed to highlight some of the prominent trends in the literature and examine how these advances manifest in algorithm development and emerging application areas."

## Section 5: Comparative Analysis of Algorithms
*(3 frames)*

### Speaking Script for "Comparative Analysis of Algorithms" Slide

**Introduction to the Slide:**
As we advance our discussion on reinforcement learning, we’ll now delve into the comparative analysis of various algorithms used in this area. This part of our presentation emphasizes the importance of understanding the performance metrics associated with these algorithms, which is critical for practitioners making informed decisions on which algorithm to apply in their specific context.

**Transition to Frame 1 (Introduction):**
Let’s begin by examining the introduction to our topic. 

**Frame 1 - Introduction:**
Reinforcement Learning, or RL, has witnessed a surge of algorithms, each offering distinct advantages and challenges. It is paramount to understand these algorithms through the lens of their performance metrics to ensure the correct choice for any given problem. Have you ever asked yourself which algorithm is the best for your project? Understanding these comparisons can help answer that question. 

**Transition to Frame 2 (Key Performance Metrics):**
Now that we've set the stage, let's go into the key performance metrics that we need to consider when evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

**Frame 2 - Key Performance Metrics:**
The first metric is **Cumulative Reward**, which refers to the total reward an agent accumulates over time from the actions it takes. It serves as a direct indicator of an algorithm's effectiveness in maximizing rewards. For example, consider a game where the agent's cumulative reward equates to the total points scored. Higher points mean better performance, right?

Next is **Sample Efficiency**. This measures how much experience the algorithm requires to learn effectively. An ideal algorithm would be one that plays chess and learns after just a handful of games, rather than requiring hundreds. Think about the implications of this in environments where training a model on extensive data could take an impractically long time.

The **Convergence Rate** is another essential metric. It defines how quickly an algorithm approaches its optimal solution. The quicker an algorithm converges, the less computational resources are expended—time is money, especially in large-scale operations. Imagine graphs that illustrate convergence rates where one algorithm outpaces another dramatically; such insights can guide algorithm selection.

Next we have **Stability and Robustness**. An algorithm should perform consistently across varying environments. This consideration is particularly crucial for real-world applications where conditions fluctuate frequently. For instance, if an algorithm excels in a simulated environment but falters in practical scenarios, its usability is compromised.

Finally, let’s consider **Computational Complexity**. This aspect evaluates the resources needed, both in terms of time and computational space. Comparing simpler algorithms, with time complexities like O(n log n), to more intricate ones with O(n²) can spotlight significant differences in feasibility, especially when deploying in resource-constrained environments.

**Transition to Frame 3 (Comparative Overview of Algorithms):**
Now that we’ve covered the essential performance metrics, let’s look at a comparative overview of several popular reinforcement learning algorithms.

**Frame 3 - Comparative Overview of Algorithms:**
Starting with **Q-Learning**, it is praised for its simplicity and effectiveness in discrete action scenarios. However, it struggles with large state spaces and tends to converge slowly. Do we always prioritize simplicity over speed?

Moving on to **Deep Q-Networks, or DQN**, this algorithm excels in handling high-dimensional state spaces through the application of deep learning. Yet, it is not without its caveats; DQNs are often sample inefficient and can diverge without precise tuning. Who has ever dealt with the frustration of getting 'off' results from a poorly tuned model? 

Next is **Proximal Policy Optimization, or PPO**. Its strength lies in its balance of exploration and exploitation, which leads to stable improvements over time. However, it demands more computational resources than simpler algorithms. Is a performance gain worth a potential increase in resource expenditure?

Lastly, let’s discuss **Actor-Critic methods**, such as A3C. These combine value-based and policy-based techniques, proving effective in continuous action spaces. However, their complexity in implementation and tuning can deter individuals looking for more straightforward solutions.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, selecting the right reinforcement learning algorithm is all about balancing these performance metrics. By examining current research and the comparative strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms, practitioners can make informed decisions tailored to their specific applications. 

**Key Points to Remember:**
- Remember the key metrics: cumulative reward, sample efficiency, convergence rate, stability, and computational complexity. Each of these factors could mean the difference between a successful or failed project.
- Utilize case studies and empirical findings from recent research; they often serve as reliable guides in algorithm selection.

**Additional Resources:**
For those interested in deepening their understanding, I recommend investigating academic papers that focus on RL algorithm comparisons, as well as programming libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch for practical implementations.

With this knowledge, I encourage you to assess and apply these concepts confidently in your reinforcement learning projects. 

**Transition to the Next Slide:**
Next, we will explore some implications of the findings we discussed today, focusing on future trends in reinforcement learning and the ethical considerations that come with advancing technology in this field. Let’s take a deeper look into how these algorithms will shape the future landscape of RL.

Firstly, we see **Enhanced Algorithm Development**. Innovations such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and multi-agent RL are paving the way for the development of algorithms that can adeptly navigate complex environments with less human oversight. For instance, consider the emergence of algorithms that fuse RL with neural networks. This combination enables more automatic feature extraction, allowing systems to adapt more efficiently in dynamic scenarios. Can you picture a self-training model that learns from its environment without explicit programming? 

Next, we note a **Real-world Applications Expansion**. Reinforcement learning is no longer confined to theoretical frameworks; it’s making its way into diverse applications across industries such as healthcare, robotics, finance, and autonomous systems. For example, consider the potential of using RL to optimize personalized treatment plans in healthcare, tailoring therapies to individual patient needs based on their unique data.

Further, the **Integration with Other AI Fields** is leading to the creation of more intelligent systems. We are beginning to see the merging of reinforcement learning with natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. A practical example of this would be chatbots that utilize RL to refine their conversation strategies by learning from interactions with users, providing an engaging and personalized communication experience. 

**Advance to Frame 3: Ethical Considerations**

Now let’s shift our focus to the ethical considerations related to reinforcement learning. As RL becomes more widespread, we must confront various ethical challenges to ensure responsible development and deployment.

Firstly, there is the issue of **Decision-making Transparency**. The intricate nature of RL algorithms can result in opaque decision-making processes, particularly concerning accountability in critical applications like autonomous vehicles and healthcare systems. How can we trust systems that don’t clarify their decision processes? This is a crucial question we all must ponder.

Next is the matter of **Bias and Fairness** in RL systems. Often, these systems can unintentionally propagate biases found in their training data. For example, if an RL model is trained on skewed historical data related to job applications, it might favor a particular demographic, perpetuating unfair outcomes. Awareness of such risks is essential in fostering equitable technology development.

Finally, we have safety and security concerns regarding RL agents. Ensuring these agents operate safely within unpredictable environments is a daunting challenge. Imagine a scenario where a faulty RL model in a robotic system operates aggressively, potentially putting human operators in dangerous situations. This illustrates how critical it is to address these safety issues proactively.

**Advance to Frame 4: Key Points to Emphasize and Conclusion**

In conclusion, there are key points we must emphasize as we reflect on these implications. One critical takeaway is that integrating ethics into RL research is essential for fostering public trust and broader acceptance of these technologies. Additionally, continuous monitoring and evaluation of RL applications will be vital as these systems grow increasingly autonomous.

Moreover, collaboration is crucial; researchers, ethicists, and policymakers must work hand in hand to establish appropriate standards and regulations guiding the development of RL technologies.

To wrap up, as current research inspires future advancements, balancing innovation with ethical responsibility will be paramount. This balance is vital to ensuring the success and societal acceptance of reinforcement learning technologies. 

Now, before we move on, I’d like to invite your thoughts. How do you foresee the implications of these technologies affecting your own field? What ethical considerations do you think we should prioritize moving forward? 

**Transition to Next Slide:**

Thank you for your insights! In the next part of our presentation, we will explore several case studies illustrating successful applications of reinforcement learning. These examples will provide valuable context for understanding how our theoretical discussions translate into real-world practices. Let's dive into that!

**Introduction to the Slide:**

Alright, everyone! As we transition into this part of our discussion, we’re going to explore several case studies that illustrate successful applications of reinforcement learning, often referred to as RL. These examples will show you how theoretical concepts in reinforcement learning can translate into real-world practice and impact various fields. 

**Frame 1: Successful Applications of Reinforcement Learning**

Let’s start by understanding what reinforcement learning entails. It's a branch of machine learning where an “agent” learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to achieve the best possible outcomes—typically maximizing cumulative rewards. 

Now, think of an agent as a student in a classroom; just like students learn from their experiences, the agent learns from the feedback it receives after taking certain actions. This process is dynamic and involves several components.

**Overview of Reinforcement Learning**

- **Agent**: Just like the student mentioned, the agent is the decision maker.
- **Environment**: This represents the space where the agent operates—similar to the classroom in our analogy.
- **Actions**: The choices available to the agent; much like how a student can decide whether to ask a question, answer one, or remain silent.
- **States**: All the possible situations the agent may face, akin to different topics or scenarios that a student might encounter during learning.
- **Rewards**: The feedback mechanism, which in terms of education can be likened to grades or feedback on assignments.

To effectively implement RL, we rely on some key concepts:

- **Policy (π)**: This is like a study strategy for the agent. It dictates how the agent chooses actions based on the states it encounters.
- **Value Function (V)**: This indicates the expected return or reward from a given state, guiding the agent’s decisions down the learning path.

As we see on the slide, the formula for the Value Function is \( V(s) = \mathbb{E}[R_t | S_t = s] \). This formula shows the expected reward an agent can anticipate given a particular state. 

This foundational understanding will set the stage for the exciting case studies we’re about to dive into.

**Transition to Frame 2: Notable Case Studies**

Now, let’s move on to some notable case studies that showcase how these concepts come to life.

Think about it—RL doesn't just operate in tech or gaming but can positively impact lives through healthcare!

**Transition to Frame 3: Key Points to Emphasize**

These case studies underline a few critical points about RL. 

- **Adaptability**: RL’s ability to adapt to various fields showcases its versatility. Whether it's gaming, robotics, or healthcare, RL applications can continuously evolve.
  
- **Learning from Interaction**: Just like how we all learn from experiences, RL agents enhance their capabilities through interactions with their environments.
  
- **Complex Decision-Making**: RL is especially effective in environments with uncertainties or dynamic challenges, which is essential across many modern applications.

Are you starting to see the vast potential of RL? It’s not just a theoretical framework; it’s an emerging powerhouse across multiple industries!

**Transition to Frame 4: Noteworthy Code Snippet**

Now, let’s take a look at a simple code snippet that illustrates the Q-learning update mechanism, which is foundational in many RL algorithms allowing agents to learn iteratively. 

Here, we have a simple Python implementation using the OpenAI Gym environment to illustrate how an agent might learn in a CartPole scenario.

```python
import gym
import numpy as np

# Create an environment
env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")

# Example of a simple Q-learning update rule
Q = np.zeros((env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n))

# Update function
def update_Q(state, action, reward, next_state):
    alpha = 0.1  # learning rate
    gamma = 0.99  # discount factor
    best_next_action = np.argmax(Q[next_state])
    Q[state][action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * Q[next_state][best_next_action] - Q[state][action])
```

This code shows how agents can improve their policies step by step. It’s fascinating to see how such algorithms mirror our own learning processes, don’t you think?

### Comprehensive Speaking Script for "Future Directions in Reinforcement Learning" Slide

**Introduction to the Slide:**
Alright, everyone! Now, we will look ahead to potential future research directions in the field of Reinforcement Learning. This is an exciting area that is continually evolving, and today we'll identify unexplored areas and suggest ways researchers can push the envelope in reinforcement learning applications.

**Transition to Frame 1:**
Let's kick off our discussion with a brief overview of why it’s crucial to identify these research directions. 

**Frame 1: Overview**
In reinforcement learning, or RL, the landscape is shifting rapidly; it’s essential for us to understand the trajectory and the trends shaping its development. Why do you think research directions matter? Well, by assessing the current trends and identifying gaps in our understanding, we can uncover promising avenues for future exploration that may lead to innovative solutions and applications. 

**Transition to Frame 2: Sample Efficiency**
With that groundwork, let’s dive into our first potential research direction: sample efficiency.

**Frame 2: Sample Efficiency**
The concept of sample efficiency revolves around developing RL algorithms that require fewer interactions with the environment to learn optimal policies. Essentially, it’s about making learning faster and less resource-intensive. 

For instance, consider model-based reinforcement learning. This approach enhances sample efficiency by modeling the environment and predicting future states, allowing the agent to simulate experiences without directly interacting with the real world. 

This improvement is particularly critical in scenarios where data collection is expensive or time-consuming—imagine deploying a robot in hazardous environments where every interaction could carry significant risks. Higher sample efficiency means that we can derive useful insights and optimizations more quickly and safely.

**Transition to Frame 3: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**
Next, let’s explore another fascinating area: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, often abbreviated as MARL.

**Frame 3: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**
MARL focuses on understanding how multiple agents interact within a shared environment or when they have competing objectives. This brings a whole new layer of complexity to reinforcement learning. 

Take a game like StarCraft II, for example. Here, individual agents must learn either collaboratively, competing for resources, or competitively, to win. As these agents engage with one another, exploring team dynamics and communication strategies becomes essential. 

Why does this matter? The insights gained from MARL can lead to more sophisticated learning frameworks capable of solving complex, real-world problems where multiple decision-makers are involved—like traffic control systems or coordinated robotics.

**Transition to Frame 4: Transfer Learning and Explainability**
Moving on, let's delve into two more critical areas: transfer learning and explainability.

**Frame 4: Transfer Learning and Explainability**
First, let's discuss transfer learning. This concept enables RL agents to transfer knowledge gained from one task to another, minimizing the need for learning from scratch. 

For instance, if an agent has been trained to navigate a maze, it can apply that learned knowledge to other similar mazes with different configurations. This significantly speeds up the learning process—imagine how beneficial that would be in scenarios where time and efficiency are critical!

On the other hand, we have explainability and interpretability. We need to ensure that the decisions made by RL agents are transparent and understandable to human users. For example, imagine an RL model that can provide human-readable explanations for its actions based on the policies it has learned. 

This is vital, especially for applications in safety-critical domains like healthcare or autonomous driving—where understanding why a decision was made can be just as important as the decision itself.

**Transition to Frame 5: Real-World Applications**
Let’s transition now to the potential for real-world applications of RL techniques.

**Frame 5: Real-World Applications**
As we explore real-world applications, we see the enormous potential for extending RL beyond simulations. We can tackle significant challenges in various fields such as robotics, finance, and healthcare. 

Consider how RL can be employed to optimize energy consumption in smart grids or improve patient treatment plans in hospitals. Bridging the gap between theory and practical deployment is where we can unlock transformative benefits across industries. 

Isn’t it fascinating to realize how these advances can enable smart systems that learn and adapt to changing environments?

**Transition to Frame 6: Visual Representation**
Next, I want to show you a visual representation of a simple Q-learning agent in action. 

**Frame 6: Visual Representation**
Here, you can see pseudocode for a Q-learning agent. This example highlights the fundamental concepts we’ve discussed today. It demonstrates how an agent learns to choose actions based on maximizing future rewards through exploration and exploitation.

In essence, this snippet breaks down the learning algorithm's mechanics, offering a practical glimpse into how RL operates. 

**Transition to Frame 7: Conclusion**
As we wrap up this section, let’s reflect on our findings.

**Frame 7: Conclusion**
The exploration of these potential future research directions can yield breakthroughs that enhance the capabilities and applicability of reinforcement learning. By focusing on areas like sample efficiency, multi-agent systems, transfer learning, and explainability, we’re poised to develop more robust and interpretable RL systems. 

These advancements help us tackle complex problems in the real world, making RL an indispensable tool in our technological arsenal. 

As we move forward into the next part of our discussion, consider how you, as students, can engage with and contribute to these contemporary research trends in reinforcement learning. What are some strategies you might employ?
