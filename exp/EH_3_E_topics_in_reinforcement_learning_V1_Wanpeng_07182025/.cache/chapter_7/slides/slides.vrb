\frametitle{Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning - Environment, State, Action, & Reward}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Environment}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Everything that the agent interacts with to make decisions.
            \item \textbf{Example}: The maze in which the robot operates or the chessboard of a chess game.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{State}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: A specific situation or configuration of the environment at a particular time.
            \item \textbf{Example}: The position coordinates of the robot in the maze.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Action}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: A choice made by the agent that affects the state of the environment.
            \item \textbf{Example}: The robot can move forward, turn left, or turn right.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Reward}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: A feedback signal indicating the quality of the agent's action towards achieving a goal.
            \item \textbf{Example}: A +10 reward for reaching the maze exit, -1 for hitting a wall.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
