### Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Define and Explain Key Concepts**: 
   - Define key terms and concepts related to reinforcement learning, including agents, environments, rewards, states, and actions.
   - Explain the differences between model-free and model-based learning approaches.

2. **Implement Algorithms**: 
   - Implement core reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning, Policy Gradient methods, and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) using a programming language like Python.
   - Utilize libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for developing reinforcement learning models.

3. **Analyze and Compare Algorithms**: 
   - Analyze the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms through experimentation, tuning hyperparameters, and using evaluation metrics.
   - Evaluate and present performance metrics (accuracy, convergence speed) using a comparative table of results from at least three different algorithms.

4. **Apply Techniques to Real-World Problems**: 
   - Design and implement reinforcement learning solutions to practical problems, such as robotics or game playing.
   - Present case studies that demonstrate successful applications of reinforcement learning in industry settings.

5. **Engage with Current Research**: 
   - Identify and summarize current research papers in reinforcement learning, articulating their significance and potential implications in the field.
   - Participate in discussions to reflect on ethical implications and future trends in reinforcement learning technology.
