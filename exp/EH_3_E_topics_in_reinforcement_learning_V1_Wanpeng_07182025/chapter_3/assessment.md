### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** Which component of MDPs represents the possible situations in which an agent can find itself?

  A) Actions
  B) Rewards
  C) States
  D) Policies

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** States define the various situations or configurations available in an MDP.

**Question 2:** What is the role of rewards in an MDP?

  A) They maintain the current state.
  B) They provide immediate feedback after taking actions.
  C) They describe possible actions for each state.
  D) They calculate state transition probabilities.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Rewards offer immediate feedback after performing an action in a particular state, indicating the benefit of that action.

**Question 3:** What does a policy represent in the context of MDPs?

  A) A strategy for reaching the goal.
  B) The possible states encountered.
  C) The rewards gained from actions.
  D) The distribution of actions available.

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** A policy defines the strategy that specifies the action to be taken for each state in MDPs.

**Question 4:** In MDPs, what does the state transition function (P) describe?

  A) The values of the rewards.
  B) The actions taken in each state.
  C) The probability of moving from one state to another after an action.
  D) The policies available for each state.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The state transition function describes the probabilities of transitioning to a new state from the current state, given an action.

### Activities
- Create an example of an MDP for a simple game (e.g., tic-tac-toe). Define the states, actions, rewards, and policies involved.
- Work in groups to simulate an MDP using a board game of your choice (e.g., chess, checkers) and discuss the decisions made.

### Discussion Questions

## Section 5: Bellman Equation Introduction

### Learning Objectives
- Introduce the concept of the Bellman equation.
- Illustrate its importance in evaluating policies.
- Explain how immediate and expected future rewards interact in decision-making.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** The Bellman equation connects the value of a state with:

  A) Immediate rewards only
  B) Future expected rewards
  C) Differences in rewards
  D) Both immediate and future expected rewards

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** The Bellman equation articulates the relationship between current state value and both immediate rewards and future expected rewards.

**Question 2:** What does the discount factor (γ) in the Bellman equation represent?

  A) The immediate reward discounting
  B) The importance of immediate rewards only
  C) The importance of future rewards relative to immediate rewards
  D) The probability of transition between states

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The discount factor (γ) determines how much we value future rewards compared to immediate rewards, where a value closer to 1 emphasizes future rewards.

**Question 3:** In the context of the Bellman equation, what is the purpose of the expected future value?

  A) To evaluate only past rewards
  B) To maximize rewards in the current state
  C) To calculate the anticipated value of states after taking action
  D) To ignore transition probabilities

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The expected future value represents the anticipated value of subsequent states reached after taking an action, weighted by the probabilities of those transitions.

**Question 4:** Which of the following is NOT a component of the Bellman equation?

  A) Value of current state
  B) Immediate reward
  C) Future state value
  D) Number of actions taken

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** The number of actions taken is not a component of the Bellman equation. The equation includes the value of the current state, immediate reward, and future state values.

### Activities
- Work in pairs to derive the Bellman equation for a simple Markov Decision Process (MDP) given a specific set of states, actions, and rewards.
- Create a small grid world on paper, assigning states, actions, and rewards, and calculate the value of a given state using the Bellman equation.

### Discussion Questions
- How does the Bellman equation facilitate decision-making in dynamic environments?
- Can you think of real-world scenarios where principles of the Bellman equation could be applied?
