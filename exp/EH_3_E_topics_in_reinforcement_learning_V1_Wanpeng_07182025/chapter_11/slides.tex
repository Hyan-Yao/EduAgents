    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful subset of machine learning that enables agents to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. RL distinguishes itself from supervised learning as it learns policy-based behavior through interactions rather than example input-output pairs. This characteristic allows RL to tackle complex real-world problems across various industries.
