- **Due Date:** Week 12, as part of project submission.
- **Grading Rubric:**
  - Depth of Ethical Analysis (50%)
  - Clarity of Reflection (30%)
  - Integration with Project Experience (20%)

## Submission Logistics

- **Canvas LMS:** All project submissions (proposals, report, final projects, and ethics papers) must be uploaded to Canvas in appropriate formats.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Students are encouraged to use Git for version control while working in teams.
- **Deadlines:** Clear deadlines are communicated at the beginning of each week on Canvas to help students manage their time effectively.

## Grading Scale

- **A:** 90-100%
- **B:** 80-89%
- **C:** 70-79%
- **D:** 60-69%
- **F:** Below 60%

## Summary
This assessment and evaluation plan emphasizes a hands-on, collaborative learning approach that connects theoretical concepts to their application in solving real-world problems in machine learning. Students will develop not only technical skills but also critical thinking and ethical awareness through iterative projects and continuous feedback mechanisms.
