    \begin{block}{Hierarchical Structure}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Agglomerative Clustering}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Starts with individual data points.
                    \item Merges them into larger clusters based on similarity.
                    \item Continues until all points are in a single cluster or a set number of clusters is reached.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Divisive Clustering}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Starts with a single cluster.
                    \item Splits it into smaller clusters.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Visual Representation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The x-axis typically represents the data points or clusters.
            \item The y-axis represents the distance or dissimilarity between clusters.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
