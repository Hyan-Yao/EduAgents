        \item Initialization
        \item Assignment Step
        \item Update Step
        \item Repeat Steps
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Initialization}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} This first step involves selecting initial centroids, which are the center points of the clusters.
        \item \textbf{Method:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Randomly select $K$ data points from the dataset as initial centroids.
            \item Alternatively, methods like K-means++ can be used to improve convergence speed by selecting better initial centroids.

        \item \textbf{Example:} For a dataset of customer purchases, randomly selecting three customers as initial centroids sets the foundation for clustering based on their purchasing behavior.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{2. Assignment Step}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid, forming distinct clusters.
        \item \textbf{Distance Metric:} Typically, Euclidean distance is used to measure how far each point is from the centroid.
        \item \textbf{Formula:}
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Cluster}(x_i) = \arg\min_{j} \| x_i - c_j \|^2
        \end{equation}
        where $c_j$ is the centroid of cluster $j$.
        \item \textbf{Example:} For 100 customer purchase amounts, each customer is grouped into Cluster A if their amount is closest to the centroid of Cluster A.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{3. Update Step}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Centroids are recalculated based on the mean of all points in each cluster after assigning all points.
        \item \textbf{Formula:}
        \begin{equation}
            c_j = \frac{1}{N_j} \sum_{x_i \in C_j} x_i
        \end{equation}
        where $N_j$ is the number of points in cluster $C_j$.
        \item \textbf{Example:} If Cluster A has five customers with amounts \$20, \$25, \$30, \$22, and \$28, the new centroid is calculated as:
        \begin{equation}
            c_A = \frac{20 + 25 + 30 + 22 + 28}{5} = 25
        \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{4. Repeat Steps and Important Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Convergence:} Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the centroids no longer change significantly, indicating convergence.
        \item \textbf{Completion:} Final clusters can be interpreted for insights.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Important Concept: Centroid}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} The centroid is the average position of all points in a cluster, serving as the representative point for that cluster.
            \item \textbf{Key Points:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The number of clusters $K$ must be chosen carefully.
                \item Sensitive to initialization; multiple runs may be needed.
                \item Limitations: Assumes spherical clusters of similar size and density.
            \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Hierarchical Clustering - Introduction}
    \begin{block}{What is Hierarchical Clustering?}
        Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning method used to group data points into a hierarchy of clusters. 
        Unlike **K-means**, which partitions data into a predetermined number of clusters, hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure that represents nested groupings of data points. 
        This allows for exploration of data at various levels of granularity.

    \frametitle{Hierarchical Clustering - Two Main Approaches}
    \begin{block}{Agglomerative Clustering (Bottom-Up Approach)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Process:} Starts with each data point as its own individual cluster and repeatedly merges the two closest clusters until all points are contained in a single cluster or a specified number of clusters is reached.
            \item \textbf{Example:} Imagine ten friends (data points) each standing alone at a party. They pair up based on how well they know each other (merging clusters) until everyone is in one large group.
            \item \textbf{Algorithm Steps:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Compute the distance matrix between all data points.
                    \item Merge the two closest clusters.
                    \item Update the distance matrix.
                    \item Repeat until all points are merged or a stopping criterion is satisfied.

    \frametitle{Hierarchical Clustering - Divisive Clustering}
    \begin{block}{Divisive Clustering (Top-Down Approach)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Process:} Begins with all data points in a single cluster and recursively splits them into smaller clusters until each data point is its own cluster or a stopping criterion is met.
            \item \textbf{Example:} Envision a sports team (data points) that starts as a single entity. The coach (algorithm) divides the team based on skill levels into specific positions, continually breaking down sub-groups until individual players are identified.
            \item \textbf{Algorithm Steps:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Start with all data points in one cluster.
                    \item Identify the most dissimilar subgroup.
                    \item Split this subgroup into smaller clusters.
                    \item Continue this process until all points are separate or until a desired structure is achieved.
                \end{enumerate}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Hierarchical Clustering - Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Flexibility:} Hierarchical clustering does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance, making it a flexible choice for exploratory data analysis.
        \item \textbf{Dendrogram Representation:} Results can be visualized with a dendrogram, which displays the arrangement of clusters and the distances at which merges or splits occur.
        \item \textbf{Distance Metrics:} The choice of distance metric (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.) can significantly influence clustering results.

    \begin{block}{Hierarchical Structure}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Agglomerative Clustering}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Starts with individual data points.
                    \item Merges them into larger clusters based on similarity.
                    \item Continues until all points are in a single cluster or a set number of clusters is reached.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Divisive Clustering}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Starts with a single cluster.
                    \item Splits it into smaller clusters.
                \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Visual Representation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The x-axis typically represents the data points or clusters.
            \item The y-axis represents the distance or dissimilarity between clusters.

    \begin{block}{Understanding Key Components}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Nodes}: Each node represents a cluster. The height at which two clusters merge indicates the distance at which they were combined.
            \item \textbf{Branches}: The length of the branches shows the similarity between clusters â€“ shorter branches indicate more similar clusters.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Cutting the Dendrogram}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Selecting a height on the dendrogram allows determination of the number of clusters.
            \item The point at which the dendrogram is cut significantly influences the final clusters.

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Species A and B are closely related.
                    \item Species C is distinctly separate.
