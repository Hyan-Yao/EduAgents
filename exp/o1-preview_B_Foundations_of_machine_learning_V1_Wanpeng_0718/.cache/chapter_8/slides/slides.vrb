    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Input Layer:} Receives input data, with each neuron corresponding to a feature.
        \item \textbf{Hidden Layers:} Transform inputs using weights and activation functions, with one or more layers referred to as "deep."
        \item \textbf{Output Layer:} Provides the network's processing result, such as classification or regression output.
