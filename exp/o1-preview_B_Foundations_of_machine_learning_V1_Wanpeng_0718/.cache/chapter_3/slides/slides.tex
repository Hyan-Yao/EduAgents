    \frametitle{Introduction to Decision Trees}
    \begin{block}{What Are Decision Trees?}
        Decision trees are a popular predictive modeling technique used in data mining and machine learning.
        They resemble a tree structure where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Internal nodes represent decisions based on feature values.
            \item Branches represent the outcomes of those decisions.
            \item Leaf nodes represent the final output (prediction or class label).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Example: Decision-Making Scenario}
    Consider a scenario where we determine whether to play tennis based on weather conditions:
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \node[draw] {Outlook}
                child { node[draw] {Sunny}
                    child { node[draw] {Humidity}
                        child { node[draw] {High} edge from parent node[left] {Don't Play} }
                        child { node[draw] {Normal} edge from parent node[left] {Play} } }
                }
                child { node[draw] {Overcast} edge from parent node[left] {Play} }
                child { node[draw] {Rain}
                    child { node[draw] {Windy}
                        child { node[draw] {Yes} edge from parent node[left] {Play} }
                        child { node[draw] {No} edge from parent node[left] {Don't Play} } };
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    In this example:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The root node is ``Outlook''.

        \item \textbf{ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Developed By: Ross Quinlan
            \item Uses entropy to measure impurity and selects the attribute with the highest information gain.
            \item Information Gain:
            \begin{equation}
              H(S) = -\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \log_2 p_i
            \end{equation}

            \item Creates classification and regression trees; uses Gini impurity for classification.
            \item Gini Impurity:
            \begin{equation}
              Gini(S) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i^2
            \end{equation}

        \item \textbf{Gini Impurity}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Primarily used in CART; aims for purity in leaf nodes to enhance model strength.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Comparison of ID3 and CART}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Overfitting}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can capture noise instead of underlying distribution, reducing performance on unseen data.
            \item \textit{Example:} A tree that perfectly classifies training data may misclassify new data.
        \end{itemize}
    
        \item \textbf{High Variance}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Small changes in data can significantly alter predictions; necessitates robust validation strategies.
        \end{itemize}
    
        \item \textbf{Bias in Predictions}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Dominant feature categories in training data may lead to biased predictions.
            \item \textit{Example:} In imbalanced datasets, a tree may default to predicting the majority class.
        \end{itemize}
    
        \item \textbf{Limitations in Predictive Power}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Perform poorly when feature relationships with the target variable are complex or nonlinear.

        \item \textbf{Model Training}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Train a separate model (e.g., decision tree) on each subset, forming an ensemble.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Aggregation}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item For regression, predictions are averaged.
                \item For classification, the mode (most frequent class) is selected through voting.
