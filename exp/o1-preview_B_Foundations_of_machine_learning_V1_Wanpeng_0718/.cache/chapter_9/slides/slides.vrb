\frametitle{Key Takeaways - Continuous Learning}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Deployed Models}: Monitor model performance over time as data evolves.
        \item \textbf{Feedback Loop}: Refine models continuously based on performance metrics and new data patterns.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Final Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Proper evaluation and tuning are crucial for robust machine learning systems.
            \item Always document your model evaluation and tuning processes for reproducibility.
            \item Optimization is cyclical; iterating is key to success in model performance.
        \end{itemize}
