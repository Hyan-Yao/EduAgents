    \frametitle{Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)}
    \begin{block}{Explanation}
        GANs consist of two neural networks—the \textbf{generator} and the \textbf{discriminator}—that are trained simultaneously. The generator creates fake data, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated data.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Motivation:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item GANs generate new data samples from a learned distribution, powerful for tasks like image generation and data augmentation.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Benefits:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Produces high-quality synthetic data.
            \item Enhances the diversity of datasets.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Example:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Image Generation:} A GAN can generate realistic-looking images from a dataset of photographs, used in creative applications and deepfakes.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Key Formula:}
        \begin{equation}
        \text{Loss for Generator} \rightarrow G \text{ maximizes output of } D
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
        \text{Loss for Discriminator} \rightarrow D \text{ minimizes difference between real and generated images}
        \end{equation}
