### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Enhanced Orientation and Resource Tools**:  
   - Implement introductory sessions/resources to address the use of Google Colab and Scikit-learn.  

2. **Supplemental Learning Materials**:  
   - Create diverse instructional resources (videos, handouts, online forums) targeting key concepts and mathematical foundations.  

3. **Regular Feedback Mechanisms**:  
   - Introduce structured feedback opportunities to assess understanding and adjust teaching strategies, especially in the early weeks.  

4. **Collaborative Learning Strategies**:  
   - Incorporate team-building activities early on and establish clear guidelines for collaboration in projects.  

5. **Differentiated Instruction Approaches**:  
   - Adapt teaching methods to cater to different learning preferences, ensuring support for both domestic and international students.  

6. **Structured Support Mechanisms**:  
   - Develop peer support systems to foster camaraderie and assist with programming and project work.  

7. **Curriculum Design and Pacing**:  
   - Pace course content thoughtfully, particularly at the start, and adjust based on mid-course evaluations to address student feedback.  

8. **Incorporation of Ethical Practices**:  
   - Use case studies and discussions related to data ethics to deepen understanding and promote responsible data use.  

9. **Continuous Feedback Mechanisms**:  
   - Implement regular formative assessments and peer reviews for proactive feedback for both students and instructors.  

10. **Inclusivity in Learning Materials**:  
   - Ensure resource accessibility in various formats and complexity levels to support diverse learning needs.
