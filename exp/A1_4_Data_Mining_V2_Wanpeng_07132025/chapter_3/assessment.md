  D) Relying exclusively on historical data without exploration.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Effective data exploration prepares teams to apply machine learning algorithms on clean and validated datasets.

**Question 4:** Which phase of data exploration involves identifying trends with visuals?

  A) Data Collection
  B) Data Cleaning
  C) Visualization
  D) Hypothesis Generation

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Visualization is a crucial step in the exploration process as it helps to identify trends and patterns within the data.

### Activities
- Create a mind map illustrating the data exploration process, including each phase from data collection to hypothesis generation.
- In groups, perform a mock collaborative data exploration session on a sample dataset, discussing insights and findings as a team.

### Discussion Questions
- What challenges do you think teams face when collaborating on data exploration?
- How can the skills learned in data exploration be adapted to different industries or sectors?
- Can you think of an example where poor data exploration led to negative outcomes? Discuss what could have been done differently.
