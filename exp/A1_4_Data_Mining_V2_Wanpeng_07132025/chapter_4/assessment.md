**Explanation:** F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which is particularly informative when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

**Question 4:** What approach can be used to prevent overfitting in supervised learning models?

  A) Increase the size of the dataset
  B) Use more complex models
  C) Reduce the learning rate
  D) Eliminate validation sets

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Increasing the size of the dataset can help to provide more examples, making models less likely to memorize the training data.

### Activities
- Form small groups to discuss how supervised learning can be applied to current projects or real-world problems in your field.
- Choose a dataset available online and outline a plan for applying a supervised learning technique to solve a specific issue.

### Discussion Questions
- What are some real-world scenarios where you believe supervised learning is underutilized?
- How do you think the choice of evaluation metric influences the selection of a machine learning model?
- What experiences do you have with overfitting, and what strategies have you used to address this issue?
