Assessment & Evaluation Planning
================================

# Assessment and Evaluation Plan for Data Mining Course (A1_4_Data_Mining)

## Overview
The assessment strategy for the Data Mining course emphasizes project-based, milestone-driven evaluations that focus on real-world applications and analytical skills. This document outlines the assessment types, milestone structure, grading criteria, submission formats, and delivery platforms.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will:
1. Apply core data mining techniques to analyze datasets.
2. Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.
3. Demonstrate algorithmic thinking through hands-on programming.
4. Integrate knowledge of advanced data mining topics.
5. Collaborate effectively on group projects.
6. Engage in ethical data practices.
7. Utilize continuous feedback mechanisms.

## Assessment Components

### 1. Project-Based Assignments (30%)
- **Format**: Python coding assignments submitted in `.ipynb` format via Canvas.
- **Timing**: Bi-weekly.
- **Content**: Focus on classification, clustering, and evaluation metrics with real-world datasets.
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Functionality (50%)
  - Documentation (30%)
  - Creativity/Innovation (20%)

### 2. Quizzes (10%)
- **Format**: Short quizzes (10 questions) combining open-ended and MCQs.
- **Timing**: End of Weeks 4, 8, and 12.
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Correctness (70%)
  - Clarity of Explanation (30%)

### 3. Integrated Group Project (40%)
- **Milestones**:
  - **Proposal (10%)**: Group project proposal due Week 4.
  - **Progress Report (10%)**: Mid-semester report due Week 10.
  - **Final Presentation (10%)**: Presentations during Weeks 15-16.
  - **Final Report (10%)**: Comprehensive report due one week after the last class.
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Execution of Project (50%)
  - Collaboration (30%)
  - Presentation (20%)

### 4. Participation (10%)
- **Method**: Assessment based on active engagement, discussions, and collaborative work.

## Submission Logistics
- **Formats**: 
  - Assignments: `.ipynb`
  - Final Report: `.pdf`
- **Platform**: All submissions via Canvas LMS.
- **Deadlines**: Outlined in course calendar. Late submissions incur a penalty (10% off for each day late).

## Grading Scale
- A: 90-100%
- B: 80-89%
- C: 70-79%
- D: 60-69%
- F: Below 60%

## Conclusion
This assessment plan prioritizes hands-on learning and real-world applications while providing structured feedback mechanisms that foster collaboration and critical thinking. The strategic alignments with course objectives ensure both theoretical understanding and practical experience in data mining.
