**Explanation:** Image classification is typically associated with supervised learning rather than reinforcement learning, which focuses more on environments where decision-making is involved.

### Activities
- Think of an application of reinforcement learning in a real-world scenario (e.g., healthcare, finance, or gaming) and present how RL can improve that scenario.

### Discussion Questions
- Can you provide an example of a real-world problem where reinforcement learning could be beneficial?
- What ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying reinforcement learning systems?
- How can reinforcement learning be combined with other machine learning techniques to enhance performance?
