    \frametitle{Overview of Reinforcement Learning (RL)}
    
    \begin{block}{What is Reinforcement Learning?}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a reward.
        Unlike supervised learning, RL relies on the agent's own experience.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Key Elements: Agent, Environment, Actions, State, Reward
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Key Concepts}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item **Agent:** The learner or decision-maker.
            \item **Environment:** The world in which the agent operates.
            \item **Actions:** Moves the agent can make.
            \item **State:** Snapshot of the environment at a moment.
            \item **Reward:** Feedback from the environment after an action.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Balancing discovering new actions and maximizing known rewards.
            \end{itemize}
        \item **Learning Process:**
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Observe the current state.
                \item Choose an action based on a policy.
                \item Receive feedback (reward) and transition to a new state.
                \item Update knowledge based on received reward.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

        \begin{equation}
            V(S) \leftarrow V(S) + \alpha [R + \gamma V(S') - V(S)]
        \end{equation}
        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \(V(S)\) = Value of the current state
            \item \(\alpha\) = Learning rate

    \frametitle{Frameworks of Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a critical area in artificial intelligence that enables agents to learn how to optimize their behavior through interaction with an environment. This slide focuses on two foundational frameworks in reinforcement learning: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
            \item Q-learning
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)}
    \begin{definition}
        MDPs provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making with random outcomes partly under the control of a decision maker. An MDP is defined by:
    \end{definition}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **States ($S$)**: Set of all possible states.
        \item **Actions ($A$)**: Set of all possible actions.
        \item **Transition Model ($P$)**: Probability of moving between states, \(P(s'|s,a)\).
        \item **Reward Function ($R$)**: Immediate reward function, \(R(s,a)\).
        \item **Discount Factor ($\gamma$)**: Factor \(0 \leq \gamma < 1\) prioritizing immediate over future rewards.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Consider a robot navigating a maze:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item States: Robot's positions.
            \item Actions: Moving up, down, left, or right.
            \item Transition Model: Likelihood of moving between positions.
            \item Reward Function: Rewards for reaching goals or penalties for hitting walls.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Q-learning}
    \begin{definition}
        Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of actions taken in states.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Q-Values**: The value of taking action $a$ in state $s$ is \(Q(s,a)\).
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{equation}
        Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left(r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)\right)
    \end{equation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\alpha$: Learning rate.
            \item $r$: Reward received.
            \item $\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$: Estimate of optimal future value.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In the robot maze, it updates Q-values after receiving rewards for reaching goals or penalties for obstacles, refining policy over time.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Takeaways and Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MDPs model decision-making environments, while Q-learning learns optimal strategies without a model.
        \item The combination of both frameworks empowers RL applications, allowing agents to learn effectively from experiences.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Understanding MDPs and Q-learning is essential for grasping advanced RL concepts. The next topics will explore the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma crucial for learning optimal behaviors.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Exploration vs. Exploitation - Understanding the Dilemma}
    \begin{block}{Dilemma Overview}
        In Reinforcement Learning (RL), the agent faces a fundamental dilemma:
        \textbf{exploration vs. exploitation}.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration}: Trying new actions to gather information about the environment and improve long-term rewards.
        \item \textbf{Exploitation}: Leveraging current knowledge to maximize immediate rewards, potentially missing better options.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        A robot in a maze:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Always taking the known shortest path (exploitation) may prevent it from discovering faster routes.
            \item Continually trying new paths (exploration) can find more efficient routes but risks wasting time.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Exploration vs. Exploitation - Balancing Strategies}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Selects the action with the highest estimated reward with probability \(\epsilon\) (0.1 for 10\% exploration).
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Softmax Action Selection}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Actions chosen based on a probability proportional to their value. Less favored actions still have a chance to be selected.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Decaying Epsilon}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Start with high \(\epsilon\); decrease as the agent learns to balance exploration and exploitation.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)}:
        Actions selected based on:
        \begin{equation}
            A_t = \text{argmax} \left( \frac{Q(a)}{N(a)} + c \sqrt{\frac{\ln t}{N(a)}} \right)
        \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Exploration vs. Exploitation - Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration} is crucial for discovering new strategies, while \textbf{exploitation} maximizes known strategies for rewards.
        \item Balancing both maximizes long-term rewards; careful strategy selection is paramount.
        \item Over-exploration leads to suboptimal short-term performance; over-exploitation can miss better long-term rewards.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Maintaining balance in the exploration-exploitation dilemma is vital for effective RL algorithms, enhancing their ability to tackle complex tasks.

    \frametitle{Types of Reinforcement Learning - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be categorized into two main types:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Model-Free RL}
            \item \textbf{Model-Based RL}
        \end{itemize}
        Understanding these approaches helps in selecting the right RL technique for specific problems.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model-Free Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        In model-free methods, the agent learns a policy or value function directly from interactions with the environment without any knowledge of the environment's dynamics.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Characteristics}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Goal}: Maximize cumulative reward over time.
            \item \textbf{Learning from Experience}: The agent learns from actual experiences (real or simulated).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Types}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Value-Based Methods}: Example: Q-Learning
            \item \textbf{Policy-Based Methods}: Example: REINFORCE
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Q-Learning Example}
    \begin{block}{Q-Learning Update Rule}
        The Q-Learning update can be expressed as:
        \begin{equation}
            Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        An agent playing chess learns to improve by playing numerous matches, relying on trial and error without knowledge of underlying strategies.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model-Based Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        In model-based approaches, the agent tries to build a model of the environment's dynamics, allowing it to simulate outcomes without direct interaction.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Characteristics}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Planning}: Allows simulating different policies using a learned model.
            \item \textbf{Efficiency}: More sample-efficient, as it learns from fewer interactions.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
