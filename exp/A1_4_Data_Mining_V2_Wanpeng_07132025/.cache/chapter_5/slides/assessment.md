## Section 16: Q&A Session

### Learning Objectives
- Encourage critical thinking and engagement on neural network topics.
- Foster dialogue on ethical considerations surrounding neural networks and their applications.
- Enhance understanding of the components and challenges associated with neural networks.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the main function of a neural network?

  A) To perform manual calculations
  B) To analyze and learn patterns from data
  C) To replace human decision-making entirely
  D) To store large amounts of data

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Neural networks are designed to analyze and learn from data patterns, enabling them to make predictions or classifications.

**Question 2:** Which component of a neural network is crucial for making decisions?

  A) Weights
  B) Biases
  C) Layers
  D) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** All components (weights, biases, and layers) play essential roles in the decision-making process of a neural network by transforming inputs into output.

**Question 3:** Which of the following is a common challenge in training neural networks?

  A) Insufficient data
  B) Overfitting
  C) Lack of computational power
  D) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** All these factors can hinder effective neural network training by resulting in poor model performance or limited learning capability.

**Question 4:** What is overfitting in the context of neural networks?

  A) When the model learns too little from the training data
  B) When the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
  C) When the model has too few layers
  D) When the training data is too large

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns specific details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively affects the performance on new data.

### Activities
- Conduct a group brainstorming session where participants propose new applications of neural networks in various sectors, considering ethical implications and real-world impacts.
- Create a mock scenario related to data mining where teams must use neural networks to solve a problem. Teams will present their approaches and discuss challenges.

### Discussion Questions
- What are some potential benefits and drawbacks of using neural networks in decision-making processes?
- How do you believe the ethical implications of neural networks will affect their future use in various industries?
- Can you think of an innovative application of neural networks that hasn’t been covered in our discussion? What potential challenges could arise?
