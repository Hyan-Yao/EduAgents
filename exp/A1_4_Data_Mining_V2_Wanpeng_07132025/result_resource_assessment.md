Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource & Constraints Assessment for "A1_4_Data_Mining" Course Delivery

## I. Faculty Expertise Requirements

### A. Subject Matter Expertise
- Instructors should possess strong knowledge in:
  - Data mining techniques
  - Classification algorithms
  - Neural networks
  - Ethical considerations in data science
- Proficiency in Python programming is a must for all coding assignments and tasks.

### B. Teaching Skills
- Communication of complex concepts and student engagement capabilities are essential.
- Experience in group project facilitation and providing constructive feedback is necessary.

### C. Technical Skills
- Familiarity with data analytics and machine learning frameworks in Python (e.g., TensorFlow, Scikit-learn) is vital for lab sessions and demos.

## II. Necessary Computing Resources

### A. Hardware
- Students require laptops capable of efficiently running Python and related libraries.
- Classrooms must have technology that supports substantial computational activities during labs.

### B. Software
- Required software includes:
  - Python and necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn).
  - Access to Google Colab for assignments is essential, along with a guide for students to navigate it.

## III. Scheduling Constraints

### A. Class Duration
- Each session is 75 minutes, allowing a mix of lectures and lab work. 
- Pacing, especially for complex topics like model evaluation and neural networks, is vital.

### B. Course Delivery Format
- An in-person format limits access for remote learners; hybrid participation should be considered.
- TA availability primarily on Monday and Friday afternoons should align with significant lab sessions and project deadlines.

## IV. Facility Limitations

### A. Classroom Setup
- Classrooms must include adequate audio-visual equipment for effective demonstrations.
- Sufficient seating and desk space are necessary for collaborative work.

### B. Access to Resources
- Instructional materials must navigate the university's LMS (Canvas) and comply with ASU policies on academic integrity and accessibility.
- A system for timely assessment and feedback is necessary to support collaborative projects and continuous evaluation.

## V. Summary of Constraints and Recommendations

### A. Faculty Expertise
- Verify faculty background matches course content; arrange for guest lectures or workshops for additional expertise.

### B. Computational Needs
- Confirm students have the necessary hardware; provide step-by-step guides for libraries and Google Colab.

### C. Scheduling
- Optimize class schedules for balanced lectures and labs, syncing with TA support times.

### D. Facilities
- Ensure adequate classroom resources; explore hybrid options to enhance accessibility for remote participation.

### E. Policies and Transparency
- Clearly communicate course policies regarding academic integrity and accessibility.

# Appendix: Actionable Recommendations

## I. Faculty Expertise Requirements
1. **Training and Support**: Organize workshops to fill gaps in advanced topics.
2. **Mentorship**: Pair less experienced instructors with seasoned faculty for guidance.

## II. Necessary Computing Resources
1. **Hardware**: Inform students about required specs in advance, providing fallback lab access if necessary.
2. **Software**: Propose setting up virtual environments for seamless library installations.

## III. Scheduling Constraints
1. **Class Duration**: Implement structured session breakdowns (Lecture:Lab:Q&A) for maximum engagement.
2. **TA Alignment**: Schedule key lab sessions around TA support timings.

## IV. Facility Limitations
1. **Tech Check**: Conduct pre-course technology checks in classrooms.
2. **Hybrid Options**: Explore hybrid delivery to support remote learners.

## V. Communication of Policies
- Include detailed policy explanations in the syllabus and revisit them regularly.

## VI. Inclusive Learning Materials
- Ensure all learning resources are accessible and formatted for diverse needs.

## VII. Feedback Mechanisms
- Implement regular formative assessments and mid-course evaluations to adjust teaching strategies.

## VIII. Community Building Activities
- Facilitate icebreakers in the first week to promote collaboration and engagement in group work. 

Through these measures, the feasibility of delivering a comprehensive "A1_4_Data_Mining" course will be enhanced, ultimately leading to a productive and engaging learning environment for all students.
