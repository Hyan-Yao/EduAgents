==============================

### Course Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Apply Core Techniques**:
   - Utilize core data mining techniques, including classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, to analyze and interpret real-world datasets from various domains such as healthcare and finance.

2. **Evaluate Model Performance**:
   - Assess the performance of implemented models using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix, ensuring the application of these metrics in contextually relevant scenarios.

3. **Demonstrate Algorithmic Thinking**:
   - Develop algorithmic thinking through hands-on programming assignments, emphasizing practical coding skills specifically in Python, with an understanding of data preprocessing techniques for effective data mining.

4. **Integrate Knowledge of Advanced Topics**:
   - Discuss and implement recent advancements in data mining, covering topics like neural networks, reinforcement learning, and generative models, while ensuring foundational concepts are established before introducing advanced topics.

5. **Collaborate Effectively**:
   - Work collaboratively on a group project that encompasses the entire data mining process from data preparation to model evaluation, culminating in a final presentation that showcases learning outcomes.

6. **Engage in Ethical Practices**:
   - Demonstrate awareness and application of ethical standards in data handling, analysis, and interpretation, in alignment with ASUâ€™s Academic Integrity Policy, including a dedicated exploration of ethics in data science.

7. **Utilize Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Engage in continuous feedback strategies, such as peer reviews and mid-course evaluations, to assess understanding and collaboration throughout the course.
