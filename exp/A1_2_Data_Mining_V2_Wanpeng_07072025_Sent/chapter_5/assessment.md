**Explanation:** Decision trees can handle both numerical and categorical data effectively.

**Question 3:** What metric is NOT commonly used to evaluate the performance of decision trees in classification tasks?

  A) Accuracy
  B) Recall
  C) F1-score
  D) Mean Squared Error

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Mean Squared Error is typically used for regression tasks, not classification.

**Question 4:** What technique can help in managing overfitting in decision trees?

  A) Increasing tree depth indefinitely.
  B) Pruning the tree.
  C) Ignoring the training data.
  D) Randomizing the tree structure.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Pruning helps remove branches from the decision tree that provide little predictive power, thereby mitigating overfitting.

### Activities
- Create a small decision tree using a simple dataset (e.g., iris dataset) and present how the tree splits based on features. Discuss the implications of each split.
- Identify a dataset from an ethical perspective and outline potential biases that could affect the decision-making process in a real-world scenario.

### Discussion Questions
- What are the potential ethical implications of using decision trees in real-world applications?
- Can you think of instances in your everyday life where a decision tree model could be applied?
