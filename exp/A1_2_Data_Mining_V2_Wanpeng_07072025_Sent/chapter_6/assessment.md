- Encourage critical thinking through discussion.
- Clarify doubts and deepen understanding of the topic.
- Understand the practical applications of Random Forests in real-world scenarios.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What does the Random Forest algorithm primarily use for prediction?

  A) A single decision tree
  B) A collection of decision trees
  C) A deep neural network
  D) A regression line

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Random Forest utilizes an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions, combining their outputs for final classification or regression results.

**Question 2:** One advantage of Random Forests is their ability to handle:

  A) Only small datasets
  B) High dimensionality and large datasets
  C) Only categorical variables
  D) Linear relationships only

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Random Forests can efficiently handle both large datasets and high-dimensional data, making them versatile for various applications.

**Question 3:** How do Random Forests manage missing data?

  A) By dropping rows with missing values
  B) Using surrogate splits
  C) Imputing missing values with the mean
  D) Ignoring the decision tree results

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Random Forests employ surrogate splits to manage missing data, allowing the model to maintain predictive accuracy even with incomplete datasets.

**Question 4:** What is a significant limitation of Random Forests?

  A) It cannot handle missing values
  B) It is very easy to interpret
  C) Slower prediction time due to multiple trees
  D) It is only suited for binary classification

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Due to the ensemble nature of Random Forests which involves multiple trees, the prediction time can be slower compared to simpler models.

### Activities
- Engage in a group discussion to compare and contrast Random Forests with another algorithm you are familiar with.
- Work on a small dataset using a Random Forest model in a coding environment like Jupyter Notebook, evaluating its performance and results.

### Discussion Questions
- What concepts from the previous slides require further clarification?
- Do you have examples from your own experiences or projects that relate to Random Forests?
- Are there specific scenarios or problems you would like to explore further regarding the use of Random Forests?
