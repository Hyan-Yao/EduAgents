  A) K-Means Clustering
  B) Hierarchical Clustering
  C) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  D) Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique for reducing the dimensionality of datasets while preserving important variance.

**Question 3:** What is a key characteristic of generative models?

  A) They require large amounts of labeled data
  B) They can generate new data points
  C) They only classify existing data
  D) They exclusively use supervised learning

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Generative models learn the underlying distribution of a dataset and are capable of creating new, similar data points.

**Question 4:** Which unsupervised learning technique is best suited for identifying outliers?

  A) K-Means Clustering
  B) Dimensionality Reduction
  C) Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
  D) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) can be effective in density estimation to detect outliers based on data distribution.

**Question 5:** What is the purpose of dimensionality reduction in data mining?

  A) To increase the size of a dataset
  B) To remove irrelevant data
  C) To create clusters of data points
  D) To simplify the data while retaining important information

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Dimensionality reduction simplifies the dataset, making it easier to visualize and analyze, while preserving essential characteristics.

### Activities
- Write a summary of the key takeaways from the chapter and how they relate to unsupervised learning.
- Select a dataset and apply a clustering technique (e.g., K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering) to identify groupings in the data. Present your findings.

### Discussion Questions
- In what scenarios do you think unsupervised learning might be more beneficial than supervised learning?
- Discuss how generative models can impact fields outside of pure data analysis, such as art or music creation.
