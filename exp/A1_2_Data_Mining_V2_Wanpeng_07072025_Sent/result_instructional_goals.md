### Learning Objectives for Data Mining Course (A1_2_Data_Mining)

1. **Understand Core Data Mining Concepts**
   - Explain fundamental concepts of data mining, including the significance of data preprocessing and the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, while integrating ethical considerations in data mining.

2. **Master Data Preprocessing Techniques**
   - Utilize data exploration, visualization, normalization, and feature extraction techniques to prepare datasets for analysis, emphasizing the importance of data quality in producing valid results.

3. **Implement and Critically Evaluate Supervised Learning Algorithms**
   - Implement and compare various supervised learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks, ensemble methods) and critically evaluate the choice of algorithms based on dataset characteristics using standard evaluation metrics.

4. **Apply Unsupervised Learning Methods**
   - Apply clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction algorithms (such as PCA) to datasets and explain the insights gained from these analyses.

5. **Explore Advanced Data Mining Topics**
   - Evaluate and apply advanced techniques, including text mining, reinforcement learning, and emerging trends (e.g., interpretability, algorithm biases), to solve complex, real-world data problems.

6. **Conduct a Comprehensive and Collaborative Data Mining Project**
   - Design and execute a final project that encompasses the entire data mining lifecycle from problem definition to results presentation, involving collaborative elements to simulate real-world team environments.

7. **Uphold Academic Integrity and Accessibility Standards**
   - Demonstrate knowledge of and adherence to ASUâ€™s Academic Integrity Policy and enforce compliance with accessibility standards, assessed throughout project work.
