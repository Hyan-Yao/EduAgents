Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

### Final Project Plan for Data Mining Course

---

#### Project Description
The final project for the Data Mining course involves a comprehensive and collaborative exploration of a relevant data mining problem. Teams will engage in real-world data analysis, applying various preprocessing and machine learning techniques, ultimately presenting their findings and implications.

---

#### Project Objectives
1. Formulate and explore a relevant data mining problem.
2. Employ data preprocessing and machine learning techniques.
3. Analyze and interpret data to derive meaningful insights.
4. Collaborate effectively within teams and present findings clearly.
5. Adhere to ethical considerations in data handling and reporting.
