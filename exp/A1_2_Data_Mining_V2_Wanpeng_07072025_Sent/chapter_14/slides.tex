    \frametitle{Introduction to Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Definition of Reinforcement Learning}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Concepts}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Agent}: The learner or decision-maker (e.g., a robot).
            \item \textbf{Environment}: The context in which the agent operates.
            \item \textbf{Action (A)}: Choices made by the agent.
            \item \textbf{State (S)}: The current situation of the agent.
            \item \textbf{Reward (R)}: Feedback from the environment based on actions.
            \item \textbf{Policy ($\pi$)}: Strategy employed by the agent.
            \item \textbf{Value Function ($V$)}: Estimates the goodness of a state.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Learning Process in Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{The Learning Cycle}
        The RL cycle involves:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation}: Discovering best actions versus maximizing known rewards.
            \item \textbf{Receiving Feedback}: Updating knowledge from rewards after actions.
            \item \textbf{Learning from Experience}: Improving the policy over time.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example: Training a Game AI}
        Consider an AI controlling a character:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{States}: Positions on the board.
            \item \textbf{Actions}: Move left, right, jump, or stay.
            \item \textbf{Rewards}: +10 for collecting an item, -1 for hitting an obstacle.
        \end{itemize}
        The AI learns to maximize its score through exploration.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Importance of Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Applications of RL}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Autonomous Systems}: Learning in dynamic environments (e.g., self-driving cars).
            \item \textbf{Robotics}: Tasks like manipulation and navigation.
            \item \textbf{Game Playing}: Training agents to play complex games (e.g., AlphaGo).
            \item \textbf{Real-world Applications}: Used in finance, healthcare, and energy for optimization.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Takeaways}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item RL focuses on trial and error for decision making.
            \item The agent-environment interaction is central to learning.
            \item RL enhances problem-solving in complex scenarios.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Formula Recap}
        The agent seeks to maximize expected rewards:
        \begin{equation}
            V(s) = E[R_t | S_t = s]
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \frametitle{Types of Reinforcement Learning - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Overview of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) encompasses a variety of algorithms that can be broadly classified into two main categories: 
        \textbf{Model-Based} and \textbf{Model-Free} approaches. Understanding these distinctions is fundamental to grasping how RL agents learn to make decisions in complex environments.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Reinforcement Learning - Model-Free}
    \begin{block}{1. Model-Free Reinforcement Learning}
        \textbf{Definition}: In model-free approaches, the agent learns to take actions based solely on the rewards it receives from the environment, without constructing a model of that environment.

        \textbf{Key Characteristics}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item No Prior Model: Agents do not develop a predictive model of the environment.
            \item Direct Learning: They learn values or policies directly from interacting with the environment.
        \end{itemize}

        \textbf{Common Algorithms}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Q-Learning
            \item SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Reinforcement Learning - Q-Learning}
    \begin{block}{Q-Learning}
        Uses a value function to evaluate the quality of actions taken in states. The value of an action is updated based on observed rewards.

        \textbf{Q-Learning Update Formula}:
        \begin{equation}
        Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
        \end{equation}
        where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $s$ = current state
            \item $a$ = action taken
            \item $r$ = reward received
            \item $s'$ = next state
            \item $\alpha$ = learning rate
            \item $\gamma$ = discount factor
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Reinforcement Learning - Model-Based}
    \begin{block}{2. Model-Based Reinforcement Learning}
        \textbf{Definition}: Model-based methods involve building a model of the environment's dynamics, enabling the agent to simulate and plan actions.

        \textbf{Key Characteristics}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Environmental Model: Agents learn a model that predicts the outcome of actions (next state and reward).
            \item Planning: They can simulate future states and rewards, facilitating better decision-making.
        \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Key Points of Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Trade-offs: Model-Free methods are simpler and require less computational resources, but may take longer to converge compared to Model-Based methods.
            \item Application Scenarios: Model-Free RL is suitable for environments with sparse data or high variability, while Model-Based RL shines in structured environments.

    \frametitle{Key Algorithms in Reinforcement Learning}
    
    \begin{block}{Introduction}
        Reinforcement learning (RL) involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. We will explore three fundamental algorithms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Q-learning
            \item SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
            \item Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Q-learning}
    
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        Q-learning is a model-free algorithm that seeks to learn the value of taking a particular action in a specific state through a value function called the Q-function.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Utilizes the Bellman equation to update Q-values.
            \item Independent of the policy being followed.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Q-value Update Formula}
        \begin{equation}
            Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \times \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
        \end{equation}
        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( Q(s, a) \): Current value of state \( s \) and action \( a \).
            \item \( \alpha \): Learning rate.
            \item \( r \): Reward received after taking action \( a \).
            \item \( \gamma \): Discount factor.
            \item \( s' \): Next state.
            \item \( a' \): Possible actions in the next state.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a simple grid world, if an agent moves from position A to B and receives a reward of +1, the Q-value for action taken from A to B will be updated according to the Q-learning formula.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{2. SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)}
    
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        SARSA is an on-policy algorithm that updates the Q-values based on the action actually taken by the agent, encouraging exploration.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The next action is chosen based on the current policy.
            \item It leads to more accurate updates reflecting the agent's experiences directly.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{SARSA Update Formula}
        \begin{equation}
            Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \times \left( r + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
        \end{equation}
        Where \( a' \) is the action taken in state \( s' \).
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a simple grid world, if the agent takes a random action from state B and receives a reward before moving again, the Q-value will be adjusted based on this sequence of actions.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{3. Deep Q-Networks (DQN)}
    
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        DQN combines Q-learning with deep learning, allowing the agent to handle high-dimensional action spaces through neural networks.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Utilizes a neural network to approximate the Q-function.
            \item Introduces techniques like experience replay and target networks to stabilize training.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Architecture}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Input: Current state (e.g., a game frame).
            \item Output: Q-values for all possible actions.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example (Pseudocode)}
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
initialize replay_memory
initialize Q_network
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = reset_environment()
    while not done:
        action = select_action(state)  # ε-greedy policy
        next_state, reward, done = take_action(action)
        store_experience(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        if replay_memory is large_enough:
            sample = replay_memory.sample()
            train_Q_network(sample)
        state = next_state
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Summary and Closing Thought}
    
    \begin{block}{Summary}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Q-learning is off-policy and updates its values based on all possible futures.
            \item SARSA is on-policy and updates values based on actual actions taken.
            \item DQN integrates deep learning, allowing agents to operate in complex environments.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
