\frametitle{Comparing Random Forests with Decision Trees - Decision Trees}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents a feature, the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome.

        \item \textbf{Pros}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Easy to visualize and interpret.
            \item Minimal data preparation required.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Cons}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Prone to overfitting with complex datasets.
            \item High variance; small changes in data can lead to different structures.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Example}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Age < 20: Likes sports
            \item Age ≥ 20 \& Active Lifestyle: Likes sports
            \item Age ≥ 20 \& Inactive Lifestyle: Does not like sports
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
