  D) It eliminates the need for data preprocessing.

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Data visualization simplifies complex datasets, making it easier to extract insights.

**Question 2:** Which technique can help reduce dimensionality in feature extraction?

  A) Randomly sampling data.
  B) Applying TF-IDF to text data.
  C) Ignoring irrelevant features.
  D) Using scatter plots for visualization.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** TF-IDF transforms raw text into a more manageable set of features, aiding in dimensionality reduction.

**Question 3:** What should be considered to avoid biases during feature extraction?

  A) Using only numerical data.
  B) Ensuring fairness in data handling.
  C) Only focusing on data accuracy.
  D) Disregarding outliers entirely.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Fairness in data processing during feature extraction is key to avoid biases and enhance model accuracy.

**Question 4:** Why is selecting the right features critical in modeling?

  A) It is only important when using complex algorithms.
  B) It helps create models that are accurate and interpretable.
  C) It allows for greater flexibility in data selection.
  D) It avoids the need for data visualization.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Choosing relevant features leads to the development of predictive models that are both accurate and easy to interpret.

### Activities
- Develop a visual representation of a data set using your preferred data visualization tool. Focus on illustrating trends or patterns.
- Select a dataset and perform feature extraction using a method of your choice (e.g., TF-IDF for text data). Present your findings.

### Discussion Questions
- How can poor data visualization affect decision-making?
- Discuss real-world scenarios where feature extraction significantly improved model outcomes.
- What measures can be taken to ensure ethical practice in data handling and presentation?
