    \begin{block}{Key Points to Remember}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Proactive Communication:} Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you need clarification.
            \item \textbf{Respect for Time:} Given that it is a break period, responses may be slower than during regular class sessions.
            \item \textbf{Plan Ahead:} Take advantage of the time to work on assignments and prepare questions for when we resume classes.
