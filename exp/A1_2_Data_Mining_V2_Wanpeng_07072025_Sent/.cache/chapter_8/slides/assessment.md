## Section 16: Q & A

### Learning Objectives
- Clarify any uncertainties regarding model evaluation.
- Engage with peers to deepen understanding of key concepts in model evaluation.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the primary goal of model evaluation in supervised learning?

  A) To ensure that the model performs well on the training data.
  B) To assess the model's performance on unseen data.
  C) To reduce the complexity of the model.
  D) To increase the number of features used in the model.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The primary goal of model evaluation is to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data, preventing overfitting.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is NOT a common evaluation metric?

  A) Accuracy
  B) Precision
  C) Efficiency
  D) Recall

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Efficiency is not a standard evaluation metric used for model performance in supervised learning.

**Question 3:** What is a characteristic of cross-validation?

  A) It is a single method of split-testing the training and test data.
  B) It partitions the dataset into multiple subsets for training and validation.
  C) It requires more time to execute than simple train-test splitting.
  D) Both B and C.

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Cross-validation partitions the dataset into multiple subsets and requires more time to execute compared to simple train-test splitting.

**Question 4:** How does the F1 score relate to precision and recall?

  A) It is the average of precision and recall.
  B) It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  C) It is the maximum value between precision and recall.
  D) It is the weight of precision multiplied by recall.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, making it useful for assessing models with imbalanced classes.

### Activities
- Form small groups to discuss and prepare a presentation on how to evaluate a machine learning model in a specific real-world scenario.
- Choose a model you are familiar with and draft a set of evaluation metrics that would be suitable for assessing its performance.

### Discussion Questions
- What considerations should be taken into account when choosing evaluation metrics for a specific application?
- In what ways do you think model evaluation can impact decision-making in business?
- How can we deal with the challenges of evaluating models trained on imbalanced datasets?
