\frametitle{Conclusion - Encouragement to Explore Further}
    This concludes our fundamental overview of Logistic Regression, a core technique in supervised learning. We encourage you to:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Experiment with different datasets using the concepts learned today.
        \item Implement and analyze model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
        \item Engage with advanced literature and online courses to expand your knowledge base and capabilities in machine learning.
    \end{itemize}

    Thank you for participating this week; your journey into supervised learning is just beginning!
