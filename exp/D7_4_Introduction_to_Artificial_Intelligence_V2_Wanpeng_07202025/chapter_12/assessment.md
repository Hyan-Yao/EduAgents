## Section 16: Q&A Session

### Learning Objectives
- Encourage open dialogue and inquiry about Reinforcement Learning topics.
- Foster a collaborative learning environment by prioritizing peer-to-peer interactions.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the role of the agent in Reinforcement Learning?

  A) The entity that provides feedback to the learning process
  B) The decision-maker that learns from the environment
  C) The system that hosts the learning algorithms
  D) The component managing the hyperparameters

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The agent is defined as the learner or decision-maker in Reinforcement Learning, interacting with the environment and learning from its actions.

**Question 2:** Which of the following best describes the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma?

  A) The agent must explore new actions or exploit known actions to maximize rewards
  B) Exploration is unnecessary in Reinforcement Learning
  C) Exploitation leads to learning from past actions only
  D) Exploration results in a reward without penalty

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** In Reinforcement Learning, the agent faces the challenge of balancing between trying new actions (exploration) and using actions that yield known rewards (exploitation).

**Question 3:** What is a characteristic of Q-Learning?

  A) It uses a deep learning architecture for feature extraction
  B) It directly learns a policy that maps states to actions
  C) It learns a value function to determine the expected cumulative reward
  D) It requires a large dataset of labeled examples to train effectively

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Q-Learning is a value-based method where the agent learns a value function (Q-value) that helps determine the expected cumulative rewards for performing actions in certain states.

### Activities
- Pair up with a peer and discuss the implications of different reward structures on agent learning, including specific examples where sparse or dense rewards play a crucial role.

### Discussion Questions
- What are the advantages and limitations of different RL algorithms? Discuss with peers.
- How do you think recent advancements in deep learning, such as Deep Q-Networks, enhance the capabilities of Reinforcement Learning?
