    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Core Components of Intelligent Agents}
  \begin{block}{Core Components Overview}
    Intelligent agents operate through three fundamental components that enable them to interact effectively with their environment:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Perception
      \item Reasoning
      \item Action
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Core Component: Perception}
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    Perception is the process by which an intelligent agent senses and interprets information from its surroundings.
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Collecting data through sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones, temperature sensors).
    \item Processing this data to form an understanding of the environment.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{block}{Example}
    A self-driving car uses cameras and LIDAR to detect obstacles, road signs, and lane markings to understand its driving environment.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Core Component: Reasoning}
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    Reasoning is the component that allows agents to process information, make decisions, and draw conclusions from the perceived data.
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Applying logical rules and algorithms to make inferences.
    \item Evaluating possible actions based on current states and objectives.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{block}{Example}
    A game-playing AI analyzes the current game board and uses algorithms (like Minimax) to predict the best move that maximizes its chances of winning.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Core Component: Action}
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    Action refers to the implementation of decisions made through reasoning, resulting in a change in the environment or the agent's state.
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Executing commands through effectors (e.g., motors, displays).
    \item Adjusting behavior based on feedback from the environment.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{block}{Example}
    A robot arm in a manufacturing plant receives instructions to pick up a part and then activates its motor to perform the task.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Points and Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The interaction between perception, reasoning, and action forms a feedback loop, allowing intelligent agents to learn and adapt over time.
    \item Each component plays a critical role in ensuring the agent can operate autonomously and effectively in complex environments.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{block}{Visualization Aid}
    Consider a simple diagram illustrating the flow:
    \begin{center}
      Perception  $\rightarrow$  Reasoning  $\rightarrow$  Action\\
      $\uparrow$                              $\vert$\\
      $\vert$                               Feedback Loop
    \end{center}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Understanding Intelligent Agents}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Intelligent Agents - Overview}
    Intelligent agents can be classified into several categories based on their functionalities:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Reactive Agents}
        \item \textbf{Deliberative Agents}
        \item \textbf{Hybrid Agents}
    \end{enumerate}

    Each type serves different purposes and employs distinct methodologies in agent design.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Intelligent Agents - Reactive Agents}
    \textbf{Reactive Agents:} 
    Reactive agents respond to sensory input without maintaining an internal model.

    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Simplicity:} Limited set of responses to stimuli
            \item \textbf{Immediate Response:} Actions based on real-time input
            \item \textbf{No Memory:} Focus solely on the present moment
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Example:} A robot avoiding obstacles by changing direction when detecting them.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Intelligent Agents - Deliberative Agents}
    \textbf{Deliberative Agents:} 
    These agents maintain an internal model of the environment for complex decision-making.

    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Model-Based:} Uses internal representation of the world
            \item \textbf{Planning \& Reasoning:} Evaluates future states based on goals
            \item \textbf{Increased Complexity:} Computationally intensive due to planning
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Example:} An AI that plays chess, planning multiple moves ahead.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Intelligent Agents - Hybrid Agents}
    \textbf{Hybrid Agents:} 
    Combine reactive and deliberative approaches, allowing for immediate reaction and long-term planning.

    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Balance:} Integrates strengths of both agent types
            \item \textbf{Flexibility:} Adapts to urgent situations while planning
            \item \textbf{Complex Scenarios:} Suitable for dynamic environments
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Example:} Self-driving cars that react to immediate obstacles and plan routes.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    Understanding the types of intelligent agents aids in selecting the right agent design model for specific applications. 

    Examples range from simple reactive robots to complex systems like self-driving cars, illustrating a broad spectrum of intelligent agent capabilities.

    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Reflex Model}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        The reflex model is the simplest form of agent architecture that operates primarily on stimulus-response behavior without any internal state or memory.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Characteristics:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reactive:} Responds immediately to environmental stimuli.
            \item \textbf{Rule-Based:} Operates based on a set of predefined rules or conditions.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Example:} A simple thermostat:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Turns on heater if temperature falls below a set point.
            \item Turns off heater if it rises above another point.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Key Points:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Advantages:} Fast and efficient in straightforward environments.
            \item \textbf{Limitations:} Unable to adapt over time or handle complex tasks requiring memory or learning.
        \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model-Based Agents}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Model-based agents maintain an internal model of the world to track the environment's state and inform decisions.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Characteristics:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Dynamic:} Update their understanding of the world.
            \item \textbf{Goal-Oriented:} Capable of planning and seeking goals, not just reacting.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Example:} An autonomous robot:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Maps its environment and avoids obstacles using its internal model for navigation.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Key Points:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Advantages:} More adaptable and can manage changes; can perform complex reasoning tasks.
            \item \textbf{Limitations:} More complex to implement and requires more computational resources.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Summary and Additional Notes}
    \begin{block}{Summary}
        Understanding the differences between reflex models and model-based agents is crucial for designing intelligent systems suitable for various applications.
        Choosing the right architecture depends on task complexity, the environment, and the level of adaptability required.
