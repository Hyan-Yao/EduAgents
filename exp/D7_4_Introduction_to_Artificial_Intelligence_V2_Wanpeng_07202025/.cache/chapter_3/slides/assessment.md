  C) They can return the position of an element in a list.
  D) They are both recursive algorithms.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Both search algorithms aim to find the position of a target element within a list, although they differ in their searching mechanisms.

### Activities
- Implement the linear and binary search algorithms on your own. Test them with various sizes of data and analyze their performance.
- Create a visual representation of the performance analysis by plotting execution time against array sizes for both search methods.
- Collaborate with a peer to implement BFS and DFS on a graph and explore how the traversal method affects node discovery.

### Discussion Questions
- What are the scenarios where a linear search might still be preferred despite its inefficiency?
- How do data structures influence the choice of search algorithm in practical applications?
- In what ways can you optimize the performance of search algorithms in larger datasets?
