\frametitle{Introduction to Alpha-Beta Pruning - Key Concepts and Benefits}
    \begin{block}{Key Concepts}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Alpha (α)}: The best (highest-value) choice found so far at any point along the path to the root for the maximizer.
            \item \textbf{Beta (β)}: The best (lowest-value) choice found so far at any point along the path to the root for the minimizer.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Benefits of Alpha-Beta Pruning}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Efficiency}: In the best-case scenario, time complexity can be reduced from $O(b^d)$ to $O(b^{d/2})$, where $b$ is the branching factor and $d$ is the depth of the tree.
            \item \textbf{Deeper Searches}: Fewer nodes evaluated allows the algorithm to examine deeper game states within the same timeframe.
        \end{itemize}
