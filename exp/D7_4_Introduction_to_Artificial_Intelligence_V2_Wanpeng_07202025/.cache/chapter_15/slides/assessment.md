**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images, making them highly effective for tasks such as image classification.

### Activities
- Conduct a hands-on session in which participants implement a simple CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras/Built-in libraries to classify images from a dataset, demonstrating their understanding of the fundamental concepts.
- Provide participants with a dataset and ask them to discuss and apply different data augmentation techniques to improve the model performance.

### Discussion Questions
- What are some challenges you think would arise when training deep learning models on small datasets?
- How might advancements in unsupervised learning impact the field of deep learning?
- In what other industries do you see deep learning technologies making significant contributions, and why?
