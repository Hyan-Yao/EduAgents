            \textbf{Method} & \textbf{Efficiency (Time Complexity)} & \textbf{Applicability} & \textbf{Notes} \\
            \hline
            \textbf{Hill Climbing} & O(n) (may become O(infinity) if stuck) & Best for problems with a single peak. & Simple to implement, but can get stuck. \\
            \hline
            \textbf{A* Search} & O(b^d) where b is branching factor & Suitable for pathfinding with known heuristics. & Guarantees shortest path if heuristic is admissible. \\
            \hline
            \textbf{Simulated Annealing} & O(k) (k = number of temperature declines) & Problems too complex for hill climbing. & Avoids getting stuck due to its probabilistic approach. \\
            \hline
            \textbf{Genetic Algorithms} & Varies widely; can be high & Global optimization in complex spaces. & Robust but requires substantial processing resources. \\
            \hline
