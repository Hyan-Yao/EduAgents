**Explanation:** The Minimax algorithm aims to minimize the potential loss in a worst-case scenario, making it crucial for decision-making in competitive environments.

**Question 2:** What is Alpha-Beta pruning primarily used for?

  A) To increase the speed of the Minimax algorithm
  B) To evaluate every possible game state
  C) To track scores better in a game
  D) To determine the best possible move without searching all branches

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization technique that helps improve the efficiency of the Minimax algorithm by eliminating unnecessary branches in the game tree.

**Question 3:** Which of the following games is known for utilizing the Minimax algorithm?

  A) Monopoly
  B) Chess
  C) Scrabble
  D) Poker

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Chess is a two-player game that extensively uses the Minimax algorithm to analyze potential moves and outcomes.

**Question 4:** In what way does Alpha-Beta pruning change the evaluation of nodes in the game tree?

  A) It evaluates fewer nodes, which can lead to faster decision-making.
  B) It evaluates all nodes equally regardless of the game state.
  C) It guarantees optimal moves are found without any pruning.
  D) It can only be used in games with a predefined number of moves.

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Alpha-Beta pruning reduces the number of nodes evaluated, improving efficiency without changing the final outcome of the Minimax algorithm.

### Activities
- Engage in a group activity where each group chooses a game, identifies how Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning could be applied, and presents their findings.
- Create a flowchart that illustrates the decision process of the Minimax algorithm with and without Alpha-Beta pruning, highlighting the differences in complexity.

### Discussion Questions
- How do you think the efficiency of Alpha-Beta pruning changes the landscape of AI in gaming?
- Can you think of games where these algorithms might perform poorly? What alternative approaches might be more effective?
- In real-world scenarios, how do you see the principles behind these algorithms adapting to non-gaming environments?
