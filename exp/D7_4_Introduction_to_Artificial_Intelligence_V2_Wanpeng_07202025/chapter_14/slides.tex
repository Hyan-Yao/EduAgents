    \frametitle{What is Machine Learning?}
    Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of relying on explicitly programmed instructions, ML allows systems to improve their performance as they are exposed to more data over time.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Significance of Machine Learning in Technology}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data-Driven Decisions:} ML empowers organizations to analyze large datasets and extract insights that inform strategic decision-making. For example, e-commerce platforms use ML to recommend products to users based on their browsing history and purchase patterns.
        
        \item \textbf{Automation of Tasks:} Many repetitive tasks can be automated using machine learning, thereby increasing efficiency. An example is the use of ML in customer service chatbots that analyze customer inquiries and automatically provide responses.
        
        \item \textbf{Improved User Experience:} ML enhances personalization. Streaming services like Netflix use ML algorithms to curate personalized content suggestions for users based on previously watched movies and shows.

    \frametitle{Important Formula for Supervised Learning}
    The objective of many supervised learning algorithms is to minimize the error between the predicted output \( \hat{y} \) and the actual output \( y \). A common loss function is Mean Squared Error (MSE):
    \begin{equation}
        MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
    \end{equation}
    where \( n \) is the number of data points.

    \frametitle{Common Algorithms in Supervised Learning - Introduction}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Supervised learning is a machine learning type where models are trained on labeled data to make predictions or classifications. 
        In this section, we will explore three commonly used algorithms:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Linear Regression}
            \item \textbf{Decision Trees}
            \item \textbf{Support Vector Machines (SVM)}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Common Algorithms in Supervised Learning - Linear Regression}
    \begin{block}{Explanation}
        Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, finding the best-fitting line through the data points.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \[
        y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon
        \]
        where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \(y\): Target variable
            \item \(\beta_0\): Intercept
            \item \(\beta_1, \beta_2, ... \beta_n\): Coefficients for features
            \item \(x_1, x_2, ... x_n\): Input features
            \item \(\epsilon\): Error term
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}

            \item Assumes a linear relationship between predictors and the target.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Common Algorithms in Supervised Learning - Decision Trees and SVM}
    \begin{block}{Decision Trees}
        Decision trees use a flowchart structure where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Internal nodes represent decisions based on feature values.
            \item Branches represent outcomes.
            \item Leaf nodes represent predictions.
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{block}{Example}
            Classifying whether a customer will buy a product based on age and income.
        \end{block}
        \begin{block}{Key Points}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Easy to interpret and visualize.
                \item Handles both categorical and continuous data.
                \item May overfit, requiring techniques like pruning.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{block}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Support Vector Machines (SVM)}
        SVM are models that analyze data for classification and regression, aiming to find the hyperplane that separates different classes in feature space.
        \begin{block}{Example}
            Classifying emails as spam or not based on content features.

        \item Common metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
        \item Each metric serves a unique purpose
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Introduction to Evaluation Metrics}
    
    \begin{block}{Purpose}
        When building supervised learning models, it's crucial to assess their performance. Evaluation metrics provide numerical values that help us understand how well a model is performing with predictions and classifications.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Accuracy**: Overall correctness
        \item **Precision**: Quality of positive predictions
        \item **Recall**: Ability to detect positive cases
        \item **F1 Score**: Balance between Precision and Recall
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Accuracy}
    
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) out of all predictions made.
    \end{block}

    \begin{equation}
    \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item TP = True Positives
        \item TN = True Negatives
        \item FP = False Positives
        \item FN = False Negatives
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        If a model makes 90 correct predictions out of 100 total predictions, its accuracy is 90\%.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Accuracy can be misleading in cases of class imbalance.

        Precision measures the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of positive predictions.
    \end{block}

    \begin{equation}
    \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        If a model predicts 40 positive cases with 30 true positives and 10 false positives, precision is \( \frac{30}{30 + 10} = 0.75 \) or 75\%.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        High precision is critical in applications such as spam detection.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{3. Recall}
    
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Recall measures the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of actual positives.
    \end{block}

    \begin{equation}
    \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        If there are 50 actual positive cases, and the model correctly identifies 40, then recall is \( \frac{40}{50} = 0.8 \) or 80\%.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        High recall is essential in contexts where missed positives are costly.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{4. F1 Score}
    
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between both metrics.
    \end{block}

    \begin{equation}
    \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        If precision is 75\% and recall is 80\%, the F1 Score is:
        \[
        \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{0.75 \times 0.80}{0.75 + 0.80} = 0.774 \text{ or } 77.4\%
        \]
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        F1 Score is useful in scenarios where both false positives and false negatives matter.

    \frametitle{3. Silhouette Score}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        The silhouette score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. It ranges from -1 to +1.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Score close to +1: Well-clustered.
            \item Score of 0: Overlapping clusters.

        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        For a data point $i$:
        \begin{equation}
            s(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max(a(i), b(i))}
        \end{equation}
        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $a(i)$: Average distance from point $i$ to the other points in the same cluster.

    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
            I = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{k} \|x_i - c_j\|^2
