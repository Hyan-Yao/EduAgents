Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource & Constraints Assessment for "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" Course Delivery

## Faculty Expertise Requirements
1. **Instructor Qualifications**: 
   - Requires a Ph.D. or equivalent experience in Artificial Intelligence, with a strong emphasis on machine learning and reinforcement learning.
   - Proven teaching experience and practical application of reinforcement learning techniques are optimal.

2. **Teaching Assistants (TAs)**: 
   - One TA will assist with grading, hold office hours, and provide coding support.
   - TA must possess a solid understanding of Python programming and AI algorithms.

## Necessary Computing Resources
1. **Hardware Requirements**: 
   - Students should have access to computers with:
     - Multi-core processors (preferably i5 or higher).
     - Minimum of 8GB RAM (more preferred for heavier tasks).
     - Dedicated graphics processing units (GPUs) may be necessary for deep learning tasks.

2. **Software Requirements**: 
   - **Python Environment**: 
     - Access to Python using Anaconda or Jupyter Notebooks.
   - **AI Libraries**: 
     - Installation of libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, and SciPy for algorithm implementation.
   - **Simulation Tools**: 
     - Platforms like OpenAI Gym for reinforcement learning experimentation.

## Scheduling and Facility Limitations
1. **Session Duration and Format**: 
   - Course duration set for 75 minutes with a blend of lectures and in-class labs.
   - Requires a classroom equipped for interactive teaching methods.

2. **Timetable Coordination**: 
   - Properly schedule to enable hands-on labs/projects while avoiding conflicts with other courses.

3. **Class Size Management**: 
   - Effective management of anticipated class size, developing strategies for larger groups to ensure quality engagement and collaboration.

## Compliance and Policy Considerations
1. **LMS and Submission Policies**: 
   - Course materials and submissions managed through Canvas, adhering to ASU academic integrity standards.
   - All submissions must comply with required formats (PDF and code) and accessibility.

2. **Course Syllabus Requirements**: 
   - Must include clear learning outcomes, grading policies, participation and assessment components, and an outline of the weekly schedule.
   - Ensure compliance with university policies related to academic integrity, Title IX, and accessibility.

## Constraints to Consider
1. **Technology Barriers**: 
   - Not all students may have access to high-performance computers or stable internet.
   - Solutions like after-hours access to university facilities or laptop loans might be necessary.

2. **Time Constraints**: 
   - Limited class time can impact curriculum depth, requiring careful allocation between theoretical knowledge and hands-on applications.

3. **Coordination with TAs**: 
   - Availability and training of the TA are crucial; inadequate experience can impact student support.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
To successfully deliver the course, it is essential to ensure that faculty expertise aligns with course content, and adequate computing resources and software are available. Scheduling must prioritize interactive learning aligned with institutional policies to maintain compliance. Addressing potential student access issues and ensuring effective TA coordination are critical for the overall success of the course. Collaborative efforts with faculty, IT, and administration can yield efficient solutions to identified constraints, enhancing student engagement and providing a comprehensive learning experience.
