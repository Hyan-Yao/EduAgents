### Assessment Components

1. **Homework Assignments (30%)**
   - **Frequency**: Weekly (16 assignments total)
   - **Content**: Theoretical problems and coding tasks (e.g., implementing search algorithms, reinforcement learning systems).
   - **Format**: PDF (.pdf) for theory and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for coding tasks.
   - **Grading Rubric**:
     - Clarity of explanation (30%)
     - Completeness of solution (40%)
     - Proper implementation and coding style (30%) 

2. **Proposal for Final Project (10%)**
   - **Due Date**: Week 8
   - **Content**: A detailed project proposal outlining objectives, methodologies, and expected outcomes based on AI applications.
   - **Format**: 2-3 page PDF document submitted via Canvas.
   - **Grading Rubric**:
     - Clear objectives and goals (30%)
     - Feasibility and relevance of methods (40%)
     - Depth of research and literature background (30%) 

3. **Progress Reports (10%)**
   - **Frequency**: Monthly (2 reports)
   - **Content**: Updates on project status, challenges faced, and next steps.
   - **Format**: 1-2 page PDF document submitted via Canvas.
   - **Grading Rubric**:
     - Clarity and organization (30%)
     - Critical reflection on progress and challenges (40%)
     - Defined next steps and action items (30%) 

4. **Group Project (30%)**
   - **Due Date**: End of Week 16
   - **Content**: Collaborative project implementing AI techniques addressing a real-world problem.
   - **Format**: Final report as a PDF and a presentation via live on-Canvas session or recorded video.
   - **Grading Rubric**:
     - Quality and originality of solution (40%)
     - Technical execution and code quality (30%)
     - Presentation clarity and engagement (30%)

5. **Cumulative Final Project (20%)**
   - **Content**: A comprehensive project integrating multiple AI techniques taught throughout the course.
   - **Format**: Final report and presentation, same as the group project; submitted via Canvas.

### Question Types
- Open-Ended Questions for conceptual understanding
- Coding tasks requiring implementation of algorithms
- Real-world scenarios for problem-solving analysis

---

### Submission Formats
- Homework and Reports: PDF format
- Coding Assignments: Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)
- Project Presentations: Recorded video or live presentation via Canvas

---

### Grading Policies
- All assignments graded out of 100 points, converted to a percentage of overall mark.
- Late submissions incur a 10% penalty per day for up to 3 days.
- Collaboration encouraged for discussions, but individual submissions required unless stated.

---

### Compliance and Integrity
- Submissions must comply with ASU academic integrity policies.
- All assignments to be submitted via Canvas for version control.

---

### Additional Resources
- Supplementary readings and online materials available through Canvas.
- Office hours and discussion forums for course-related clarifications.

By integrating these assessment types, the course aims to enhance understanding of AI concepts while developing practical skills relevant to real-world applications.
