  A) Loves(x, y)
  B) isEven(x)
  C) Between(x, y, z)
  D) GreaterThan(a, b)

**Correct Answer:** B

  A) ∃x (Bird(x) ∧ CanFly(x))
  B) ∀x (Human(x) → Mortal(x))
  C) ∀x (Cat(x) ∨ Dog(x))
  D) ∃x (Mammal(x) → Reptile(x))

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The statement 'For all x, if x is a human, then x is mortal' correctly uses the universal quantifier (∀) to make a general assertion.

**Question 3:** What does the existential quantifier (∃) assert?

  A) A property is true for all elements in the domain.
  B) There is at least one element in the domain for which the property is true.
  C) No elements in the domain satisfy the property.
  D) All elements in the domain satisfy the property.

  A) ∃x (Bird(x) → CanFly(x))
  B) ∀x (Bird(x) → CanFly(x))
  C) ∀x (CanFly(x) → Bird(x))
  D) ∃x (CanFly(x) ∧ Bird(x))

**Correct Answer:** B

**Question 2:** What does the universal quantifier (∀) indicate in FOL?

  A) A statement holds for some elements
  B) A statement holds for all elements
  C) A statement is not true
  D) A statement is true for exactly one element

**Explanation:** The universal quantifier (∀) signifies that the statement is true for every element in the domain.

**Question 3:** Which of the following statements is an example of an existential quantifier?

  A) ∀x (Human(x) → Mortal(x))
  B) ∃y (Bird(y) ∧ CanFly(y))
  C) P(a) ∧ Q(b)
  D) R(x,y) → S(x)

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The statement ∃y (Bird(y) ∧ CanFly(y)) indicates that there exists some y that satisfies both conditions, which is characteristic of existential quantification.

**Question 4:** Which logical connective represents 'if and only if' in FOL?

  A) ∧
  B) ∨
  C) ¬
  D) ↔

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** The biconditional connective (↔) represents 'if and only if' in First-Order Logic, indicating that both sides of the expression are equivalent.

  A) A syntactic representation of a logical statement.
  B) An abstraction that doesn't assign meanings to predicates.
  C) A specific interpretation that makes certain sentences true.
  D) A set of axioms that are always true.

**Question 3:** Which of the following components is NOT part of an interpretation in FOL?

  A) Domain
  B) Predicate Interpretation
  C) Syntactic Forms
  D) Assignment Functions

**Correct Answer:** C

  A) The formula is syntactically correct.
  B) The formula has a proof in FOL.
  C) The statements made by the formula are correct under the model's interpretation.

  A) Some students study
  B) All students study
  C) No students study

**Question 2:** Which of the following statements can propositional logic NOT express?

  A) All humans are mortal.
  B) Socrates is mortal.
  C) It is raining or it is sunny.
  D) Alice is taller than Bob.

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Propositional logic cannot express universal statements like 'All humans are mortal' as it lacks quantifiers.

  B) Alice is tall. Bob is short.
  C) If Alice is tall, then Bob is short.

  A) All humans are mortal.
  B) Some humans are not mortal.
  C) No humans are mortal.
  D) Humans are not necessarily mortal.

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** The statement states that for all x, if x is a Human, then x is Mortal, which means all humans are mortal.

**Question 2:** What does the statement ∃x (Animal(x) ∧ ¬CanFly(x)) convey?

  A) All animals can fly.
  B) No animals can fly.
  C) Some animals cannot fly.
  D) Some animals can fly.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The statement indicates that there exists at least one animal x that does not have the ability to fly, which conveys that some animals cannot fly.

  A) Every student has at least one friend.
  B) Some students do not have friends.
  C) No students have friends.
  D) Only some students have at least one friend.

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** This states that for every entity x, if x is a student, then there exists some entity y such that x has y as a friend, asserting that every student has at least one friend.

**Question 4:** Which of the following statements is equivalent to ¬∀x (Animal(x) → CanFly(x))?

  A) All animals can fly.
  B) At least one animal cannot fly.
  C) Some animals can fly.
