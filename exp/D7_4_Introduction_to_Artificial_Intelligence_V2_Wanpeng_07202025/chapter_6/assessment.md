- Develop a group project where students design a simple cooperative multi-agent system. Each student can represent an agent with different capabilities, and define how they will interact to achieve a common goal.
- Create a case study that evaluates the effectiveness of multi-agent systems in a chosen application area, such as traffic management or smart grids. Students will present their findings and conclusions.

### Discussion Questions
- How can the characteristics of agents' autonomy and social ability coexist in a multi-agent system?
- In your opinion, what are some future applications of multi-agent systems that could emerge in the next decade?
