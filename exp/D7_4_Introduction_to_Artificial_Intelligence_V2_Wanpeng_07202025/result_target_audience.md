### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Segmentation of Knowledge Gaps**:
   - Classify knowledge gaps into 'critical' (foundational AI concepts and mathematical foundations) and 'non-critical' (advanced concepts) to prioritize early course content.

2. **Tailored Learning Paths**:
   - Implement differentiated instruction strategies that allow advanced students to undertake more challenging projects while providing foundational resources for those needing additional support.

3. **Curricular Flexibility**:
   - Include industry discussions or guest lectures to bridge theory with practical applications aligned with career aspirations.

4. **Feedback Loops**:
   - Establish weekly reflections or surveys to gather student feedback, enabling timely adjustments to content delivery and support resources.

5. **Incorporation of Project-Based Learning**:
   - Make project-based learning central to assessments, potentially integrating a capstone project to enhance engagement and hands-on experience.

6. **Supplemental Resources**:
   - Create modular resources for self-paced engagement on complex topics, such as video tutorials, interactive simulations, and curated online course materials.

7. **Peer Support Structures**:
   - Introduce peer-led study groups or mentorship opportunities to strengthen community, especially benefiting international students with localized support.

By implementing these data-driven recommendations, the course can better meet student needs and career aspirations while fostering an inclusive and engaging learning environment.
