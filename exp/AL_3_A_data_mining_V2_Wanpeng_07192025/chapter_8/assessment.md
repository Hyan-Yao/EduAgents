### Learning Objectives
- Understand the definition and importance of association rules in data mining.
- Recognize the components of association rules including support, confidence, and lift.
- Identify real-world applications of association rules in various industries.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What does an association rule in the format {A} → {B} indicate?

  A) Item A is always bought with item B.
  B) There is a likelihood of buying item B if item A is bought.
  C) Item A and item B are the same.
  D) Item B causes the purchase of item A.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The association rule {A} → {B} suggests that the presence of item A in a transaction increases the likelihood of item B also being present.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is NOT a metric used in association rule mining?

  A) Support
  B) Confidence
  C) Variance
  D) Lift

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Variance is a statistical measure used in other contexts but is not used as a metric in association rule mining.

  A) Milk and eggs
  B) Milk and refrigerator
  C) Eggs and frying pan
  D) Bread and bakery

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Milk and eggs are typical examples of items that may be bought together in a grocery store setting, demonstrating the principle of association.

  A) The number of transactions involving item A.
  B) The boost in the likelihood of purchasing item B when item A is also purchased.
  C) The changes in sales volume.
  D) The average time between purchases.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Lift measures the strength of the association between items A and B compared to what would be expected if they were independent.

  B) It assesses the strength of association when items are independent
  C) It measures the baseline probability of items
  D) It does not consider independence
