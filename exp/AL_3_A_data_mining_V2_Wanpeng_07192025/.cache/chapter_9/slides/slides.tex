    \begin{block}{Clustering}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups objects such that objects in the same group (or cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
            \item \textbf{How It Works:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item No pre-existing labels are needed; the algorithm identifies structures in the data.
                \item Common approaches involve techniques like k-means and hierarchical clustering.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Example:} A business might use clustering to identify distinct groups of customers based on purchasing behavior without prior categorization.
            \item \textbf{Key Algorithms:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item K-means
                \item DBSCAN
                \item Hierarchical Clustering
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Association Rules}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} Association rule learning is a rule-based method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases.
            \item \textbf{How It Works:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Often used in market basket analysis to uncover products frequently bought together.
                \item The rules are expressed in the form "If A, then B".
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Key Metrics:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Support:} Proportion of transactions that include a specific itemset.
                \item \textbf{Confidence:} Likelihood of occurrence of the consequent given the antecedent.
                \item \textbf{Lift:} Ratio of the observed support to that expected if A and B were independent.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Example:} "If a customer buys bread, they are likely to buy butter", leading to effective cross-selling strategies.
