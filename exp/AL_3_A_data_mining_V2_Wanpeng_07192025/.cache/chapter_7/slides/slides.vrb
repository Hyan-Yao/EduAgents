\frametitle{Types of Clustering Techniques - K-means & K-medoids}
    \begin{block}{K-means Clustering}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Select 'k' initial centroids.
            \item Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
            \item Recalculate centroids based on assignments.
            \item Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.
        \end{enumerate}
        \textbf{Advantages:} Simple, efficient with large datasets, and easy to implement.\\
        \textbf{Limitations:} Sensitive to outliers and requires predefined 'k'.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{K-medoids (PAM)}
        Similar concept but uses actual data points as centroids (medoids), making it less sensitive to outliers.
