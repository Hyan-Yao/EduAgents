Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

### Learning Objectives

1. **Data Mining Principles**: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to articulate key data mining principles, including classification, clustering, and association rules with examples and real-world applications, assessed through quizzes and reflection papers.

2. **Classification Algorithms Proficiency**: Students will demonstrate proficiency in at least three classification algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests—by describing their applications, benefits, and limitations through exams and practical assignments.

3. **Tool Utilization**: Students will effectively use data mining software (e.g., R, Python, or specialized mining tools) to perform analyses on various datasets, detailing specific types of analyses conducted in their project reports.

4. **Implementation of Projects**: Throughout the course, students will engage in project-based assessments where they will identify a real-world problem, deploy appropriate data mining techniques (e.g., classification, clustering), and present their findings, demonstrating understanding and application.

5. **Critical Analysis of Results**: Students will evaluate the effectiveness of different data mining techniques through hands-on exercises and will write reflective pieces discussing how specific methodologies influence results and decision-making processes.

6. **Ethical Practices**: By the end of the course, students will identify and discuss data ethics standards and the implications of data privacy on their data mining practices, supported by case studies analyzing ethical dilemmas in data mining scenarios.
