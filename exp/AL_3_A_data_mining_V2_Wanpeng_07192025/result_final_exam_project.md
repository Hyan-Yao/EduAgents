# Final Project Plan: Real-World Application of Data Mining Techniques

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to replace the traditional exam with a project-based assessment that aligns with the course learning objectives related to data mining techniques, ethical practices, and real-world problem-solving skills. 

## Objectives
1. **Articulate Data Mining Principles**: Identify key concepts such as classification algorithms and their real-world applications.
2. **Demonstrate Proficiency in Algorithms**: Apply Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to solve practical data mining problems.
3. **Utilize Data Mining Tools**: Leverage R or Python for implementing data mining techniques and analyzing datasets effectively.
4. **Implement Project-Based Learning**: Engage with real-world datasets to identify problems, deploy data mining techniques, and present findings.
5. **Evaluate Outcomes**: Analyze the effectiveness of the methodology and its implications.
6. **Discuss Ethical Implications**: Review ethical considerations relevant to data mining.
