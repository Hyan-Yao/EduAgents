    \frametitle{Overview of Decision Trees as a Classification Method}
    
    \begin{block}{What are Decision Trees?}
        Decision trees are a powerful, visual tool used in machine learning, specifically for classification and regression tasks. They represent decisions and their possible consequences in a tree-like structure, allowing for easy interpretation of decision-making processes.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Hierarchical Structure}: Comprised of nodes (decisions) and branches (possible outcomes), resembling a tree.
        \item \textbf{Recursive Splitting}: Each internal node splits the dataset based on a feature's value, leading to branches that represent the outcomes of a decision.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Why Use Decision Trees?}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Intuitive and Easy to Understand}: The tree structure mimics human decision-making and is visually easy to interpret.
        \item \textbf{No Data Preparation Required}: Unlike many algorithms, decision trees do not require extensive data preprocessing.
        \item \textbf{Handles Both Numerical and Categorical Data}: They can be used for various data types, improving flexibility.
        \item \textbf{Identifies Interaction Between Features}: Decision trees capture relationships between several variables, making them useful in complex datasets.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Real-World Example}
    
    \begin{block}{Healthcare Prediction}
        In a medical setting, decision trees can help classify patients based on symptoms to predict whether they may have a particular disease. The decision tree would ask questions like:
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item "Is the temperature above 100Â°F?"
            \item "Does the patient have a cough?"
        \end{itemize}
        
        Each 'yes' or 'no' leads to another question until a conclusion is reached (e.g., "Predicted Diagnosis: Influenza").
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Structure}: A decision tree consists of root nodes, internal nodes, and leaf nodes.
        \item \textbf{Splitting Criteria}: Common criteria for making splits include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Gini Impurity}: Measures how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly labeled.
            \item \textbf{Entropy}: Measures the level of disorder or unpredictability in the dataset.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Overfitting/Underfitting}: Decision trees can easily overfit training data; pruning (removing branches) ensures generalization.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Basic Algorithm Steps}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Start with the entire dataset.
        \item Choose the best feature to split on according to the chosen criterion (Gini, Entropy, etc.).
        \item Split the dataset into subsets based on the selected feature.
        \item Repeat steps 2-3 for each subset until stopping criteria are met (e.g., a minimum number of samples in a leaf node or maximum depth).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    
    Decision trees are a fundamental method in machine learning, offering a clear, interpretable way to make decisions based on data.

    \begin{block}{Introduction to Decision Trees}
        Decision Trees are a popular machine learning model used for both classification and regression tasks. They mimic human decision-making by creating a tree-like structure of decisions based on specific attributes.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Building Decision Trees - Steps}
    \begin{block}{Process of Constructing Decision Trees}
        The construction involves several key steps:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Data Collection}: Gather relevant data that includes both features and the target variable.
            \item \textbf{Preprocessing}: Clean the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
            \item \textbf{Choosing a Splitting Criterion}: Decide how to split the dataset using metrics like:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Gini Impurity
                    \item Information Gain (Entropy)
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Building the Tree}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Start at the root with the entire dataset.
                    \item Split the data based on the chosen criterion.
                    \item Repeat the process recursively until stopping conditions are met.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Pruning the Tree}: Remove branches that have little importance to enhance model generalization.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Building Decision Trees - Example}
    \begin{block}{Example of Building a Decision Tree}
        Consider a dataset of loan applicants with features: credit score, income, and loan amount. The target variable is loan approval (Yes/No).
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Initial Node}: Calculate Gini Impurity or Information Gain to determine the first feature to split.
            \item \textbf{First Split}: If splitting on 'credit score', create branches:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item High credit score (approved)
                    \item Low credit score (not approved)
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Further Splits}: Continue splitting based on features like 'income' in the low credit score group.

    \begin{block}{Summary}
        By understanding the steps of building decision trees, students can effectively implement these algorithms in real-world scenarios.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Splitting Criteria - Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In decision tree construction, the choice of splitting criteria is vital for model effectiveness.
        \item Commonly used criteria include \textbf{Gini impurity} and \textbf{entropy}.
        \item These metrics help quantify the quality of a split and guide the decision-making process in tree construction.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Splitting Criteria - Gini Impurity}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Gini impurity measures the degree of impurity in a dataset.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
            Gini(D) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{C} p_i^2
        \end{equation}
        \textbf{Where:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( D \) is the dataset
            \item \( C \) is the number of classes
            \item \( p_i \) is the proportion of class \( i \) in the dataset
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Interpretation}
        A lower Gini impurity indicates a more "pure" node.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Given class distribution:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Class A: 5
            \item Class B: 3
            \item Class C: 2
        \end{itemize}
        \[
        Gini(D) = 1 - \left( \left(\frac{5}{10}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2}{10}\right)^2 \right) = 0.62
        \]
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Splitting Criteria - Entropy}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Entropy measures the amount of uncertainty in a dataset.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
            Entropy(D) = - \sum_{i=1}^{C} p_i \log_2(p_i)
        \end{equation}
        \textbf{Where:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( p_i \) is the proportion of class \( i \) in the dataset
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Interpretation}
        Lower entropy indicates less disorder and higher purity.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Using the same dataset:
        \[
        Entropy(D) \approx 1.57
        \]
    \end{block}
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Splitting Criteria - Key Points and Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Both Gini impurity and entropy are critical for assessing dataset splits.
        \item Gini impurity is computationally faster; entropy is more precise.
        \item Their minimization directly influences the predictive performance of decision trees.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Summary}
        Understanding these criteria is essential for building accurate decision trees, leading to better model performance on unseen data.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Pruning Techniques - Importance}

    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Pruning is a crucial technique in decision tree algorithms aimed at improving the model's performance by mitigating overfitting.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Overfitting occurs when a model learns too much detail from the training data, capturing noise instead of the underlying distribution.
        \item A well-pruned model performs exceptionally well on unseen data, unlike an overfitted model.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Why Prune?}
        Pruning helps:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Improve model generalization to new data
            \item Reduce model complexity for better interpretability
            \item Enhance predictive performance by eliminating noise
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Pruning Techniques - Methods}

    \begin{block}{Types of Pruning Techniques}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Pre-Pruning (Early Stopping):}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Stops tree growth early based on criteria (e.g., minimum samples).
                    \item \textbf{Example:} A node with fewer than 10 data points may not split further.
                \end{itemize}

            \item \textbf{Post-Pruning:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Grows a full tree then removes nodes with little predictive power.
                    \item \textbf{Method:} Cost Complexity Pruning - balances tree size with training accuracy.
                    \item \textbf{Example:} If a node's growth increases validation error, it can be pruned.
                \end{itemize}

    A decision tree is a flow-chart-like structure used to make decisions based on various input features. 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each internal node represents a decision based on a given feature.
        \item Each branch represents the outcome of that decision.
        \item Each leaf node represents a final decision or classification.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Key Concepts}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Nodes}:

    \textbf{Next Steps:} 
    In the following slide, we will discuss the limitations of Decision Trees, including their potential for overfitting and sensitivity to variations in data.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Limitations of Decision Trees}
  \begin{block}{Introduction}
    While decision trees are a popular tool in machine learning due to their interpretability and ease of use, they come with several limitations that can impact their effectiveness in certain scenarios. Understanding these drawbacks is crucial for any data scientist or analyst.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Limitations of Decision Trees - Overfitting}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Definition:} Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data due to excessive complexity.
    \item \textbf{Explanation:} Decision trees can become too intricate by growing deep (with many splits), capturing noise or peculiarities in the training data rather than the underlying distribution. This makes them less generalizable.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Example}
    Imagine training a decision tree to classify animals based on features (color, number of legs, etc.). If the tree splits excessively based on rare attributes (like a unique fur color), 
    it may misclassify other animals in real-world scenarios.
  \end{block}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mitigation Techniques:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Pruning: This process involves cutting back the tree to prevent it from growing too complex.
        \item Setting Maximum Depth: Limiting the depth of the tree during creation.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Limitations of Decision Trees - Sensitivity to Data Variations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Definition:} Decision trees can be heavily influenced by small changes in the training data.
    \item \textbf{Explanation:} A slight alteration in input data can lead to a completely different tree structure, making the model unstable.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Example}
    If we have a dataset where a few samples are outliers (e.g., a few dogs listed as having six legs), a decision tree may create a branching path based on this incorrect information, impacting its accuracy on new data.
  \end{block}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mitigation Techniques:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Ensemble Methods: Techniques such as Random Forests combine multiple decision trees, stabilizing predictions.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Points and Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Decision trees can easily become too complex, leading to overfitting.
    \item They are sensitive to variations in training data; small changes can significantly impact the modelâs predictions.
    \item Effective management strategies like pruning, limiting tree depth, or utilizing ensemble methods can help mitigate these limitations.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Conclusion}
    Despite their drawbacks, understanding the limitations of decision trees allows practitioners to take informed steps 
    to enhance their predictive performance, thus improving the decision-making process in various applications.
