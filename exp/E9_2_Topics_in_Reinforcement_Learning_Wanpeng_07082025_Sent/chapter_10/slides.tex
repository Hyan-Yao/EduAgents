    \frametitle{Relevant Formulas}
    The fundamental equations in RL can be summarized by the Q-learning update rule:
    
    \begin{equation}
        Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left[ r_t + \gamma \max_{a} Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s_t, a_t) \right]
    \end{equation}
    
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( s_t \): current state
        \item \( a_t \): action taken
        \item \( r_t \): reward received
