Assessment & Evaluation Planning
================================

# Assessment and Evaluation Plan for E9_2: Topics in Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This assessment strategy emphasizes project-based evaluations to promote practical applications of reinforcement learning (RL) concepts, fostering analytical thinking, collaborative skills, and real-world relevance.

## Assessment Components

### 1. Homework Assignments (25%)
- **Format**: Weekly problem sets and coding assignments (.ipynb files).
- **Timing**: Due every Friday at the end of weeks 2-11.
- **Content**: Theoretical analysis, algorithmic derivations, and computational studies based on weekly topics.
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Clarity of Explanation (25%)
  - Correctness of Solutions (50%)
  - Implementation Quality (25%)

### 2. Research Project (45%)
- **Final Deliverables**: Written report and formal presentation at the end of the course.
- **Milestone Breakdown**:
  - **Proposal (Week 7)**:
    - Format: 2-page (.pdf) proposal outlining research question, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes.
    - Submission: Canvas.
    - Grading Rubric:
      - Relevance & Originality (30%)
      - Clarity of Objectives (30%)
      - Feasibility of Project Plan (40%)
  
  - **Progress Report (Week 11)**:
    - Format: 3-page (.pdf) update documenting progress, challenges faced, and adjustments to the research plan.
    - Submission: Canvas.
    - Grading Rubric:
      - Depth of Progress (40%)
      - Identification of Challenges (30%)
      - Proposed Solutions (30%)

  - **Final Report (Week 15)**:
    - Format: 10-15 page (.pdf) research paper including literature review, methodologies, findings, and conclusions.
    - Grading Rubric:
      - Quality of Research (40%)
      - Depth of Analysis (30%)
      - Presentation & Formatting (20%)
      - Overall Contribution to RL Field (10%)

### 3. Class Participation (10%)
- **Assessment Method**: Evaluation of participation in discussions, peer reviews, and in-class activities.
- **Grading**: Pass/Fail based on engagement and contribution.

### 4. Mid-Course Feedback (10%)
- **Format**: Anonymous survey conducted in week 8.
- **Content**: Feedback on course structure, pacing, and clarity.
- **Evaluation**: Based on actionable feedback received and implemented.

### 5. Peer Evaluation (10%)
- **Method**: Peer assessments during group project presentations.
- **Grading**: Feedback on collaboration, contribution, and teamwork.
- **Rubric**: Engagement, contribution to team output, and effectiveness in discussions.

## Assessment Logistics
- **Submission Format**: All assessments submitted through Canvas LMS.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Timely feedback on homework within one week; project milestones receive feedback during scheduled sessions in weeks 11 and 14.
- **Long-Term Planning**: Clear timelines communicated at the course start, with reminders sent two weeks before deadlines.

## Final Project
- **Cumulative Assessment**: Final project integrates learning from the course, addressing specific RL problems using techniques learned in class.
- **Content**: Collaboration to analyze real-world scenarios or theoretical advancements in RL.

Through this structured assessment plan, students will develop critical thinking, collaboration, and deeper engagement with reinforcement learning applications, preparing them for professional success in the field.
