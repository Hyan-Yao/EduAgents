**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The primary goal of reinforcement learning is to enable the agent to maximize cumulative rewards based on its interactions with the environment.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is NOT a core component of reinforcement learning?

  A) Agent
  B) Actions
  C) States
  D) Clustering

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Clustering is not a component of reinforcement learning; it's a separate machine learning technique focused on grouping data points.

**Question 3:** What does the 'exploration vs. exploitation' trade-off refer to in reinforcement learning?

  A) Choosing between using machine learning models and rules-based systems
  B) Deciding whether to try new actions or use known ones for higher rewards
  C) Evaluating different environments for training an agent
  D) Determining the complexity of algorithms used

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The exploration vs. exploitation trade-off specifically involves the decision of whether to explore new actions or exploit known actions that yield high rewards.

**Question 4:** Which algorithm is often characterized as model-free and is used to find the optimal action-selection policy?

  A) Q-Learning
  B) Support Vector Machines
  C) Decision Trees
  D) K-Means Clustering

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that finds the best action-selection policy through the use of a value function.
