   - Proficiency in foundational concepts: Markov Decision Processes, Q-Learning, and optimization techniques.
   - Practical experience applying RL techniques in real-world scenarios.

2. **Teaching Assistant (TA)**: 
   - Technical competencies in reinforcement learning algorithms and mathematical modeling.
   - Ability to assist with lectures, grading, and providing detailed feedback on student work.
   - Initial training on course content and RL resources.

3. **Guest Lecturers (optional)**:
   - Considered for depth in specific topics; require coordination in advance for seamless integration.

## Necessary Computing Resources
1. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - **Computers**: Access to computers with GPUs for efficient training of RL models.
   - **Network**: Reliable internet access to utilize cloud resources and libraries.

2. **Software Requirements**:
   - **Programming Language**: Proficiency in Python or similar language for RL.
   - **Libraries/Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, and other relevant RL libraries installed.
   - **Mathematical Tools**: MATLAB, R, or specialized optimization software.

3. **Cloud Computing**:
   - Consider using cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) if institutional hardware is limited.
   - Evaluate licensing and compliance for cloud resource usage.

4. **Virtual Environments**:
   - Set up pre-configured virtual environments for student ease in accessing all necessary libraries.

## Instructional Delivery Context
1. **Session Duration**:
   - Each session is 2.5 hours; incorporate breaks to enhance engagement.

2. **Delivery Format**:
   - Combine in-person lectures, video lectures, and readings.
   - Requires classrooms with proper audio-visual technology for effective presentations.

3. **Interactive Hands-On Sessions**:
   - Integrate lab sessions for practical coding of RL algorithms to foster active learning.

4. **Collaboration Tools**:
   - Utilize platforms like GitHub for project collaboration and version control.

## Scheduling Constraints
1. **TA Availability**:
   - Consider TA workload when scheduling project timings and assignment deadlines.
   - Early drafts for feedback to facilitate timely improvements.

2. **Classroom Booking**: 
   - Ensure availability for specified session durations and consider maximum enrollment limits.

3. **Course Calendar Flexibility**:
   - Design a balanced workload to avoid overwhelming students; allow for adequate time for group projects.

## Compliance and Policies
1. **Institutional Policies**:
   - Adhere to academic integrity, accessibility standards, and copyright compliance.
   - Prepare course materials reflecting these standards.

2. **Canvas Utilization**:
   - Ensure timely loading of instructional materials on Canvas for efficient course management.
   - Provide initial training on the LMS for faculty and students.

3. **Regular Compliance Training**:
   - Schedule a session at the beginning of the course to inform students on compliance matters.

## Additional Recommendations
1. **Continuous Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Implement mid-course surveys to gauge student engagement and understanding, allowing for real-time adjustments.

2. **Community Building**:
   - Encourage formation of study groups for peer-to-peer learning and enhanced collaborative skills.

## Conclusion
The effective delivery of "E9_2_Topics in Reinforcement Learning" is contingent upon a thorough alignment of faculty expertise, availability of advanced computing resources, compliance with institutional policies, and strategic scheduling. Proactive planning in each of these areas will facilitate a successful and enriching educational experience for students in the realm of reinforcement learning.
