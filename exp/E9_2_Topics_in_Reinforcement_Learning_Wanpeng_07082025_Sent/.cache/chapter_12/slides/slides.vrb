\frametitle{Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning - Overview}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{What is Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item DRL combines \textbf{Reinforcement Learning (RL)} and \textbf{Deep Learning (DL)}.
            \item Involves an agent making decisions by interacting with an environment.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Concepts:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Agent}: Decision-maker (e.g., robot).
            \item \textbf{Environment}: Context or setting (e.g., maze).
            \item \textbf{State (s)}: Current situation representation.
            \item \textbf{Action (a)}: Choices available to the agent.
            \item \textbf{Reward (r)}: Feedback based on action taken.
            \item \textbf{Policy (Ï€)}: Strategy for decision-making.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
