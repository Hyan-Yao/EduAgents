\frametitle{Key Components of MDPs}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{States (S)}: A set of states \( S \) representing all possible situations for the agent.
        \item \textbf{Actions (A)}: A set of actions \( A \) that the agent can take, influencing the state of the environment.
        \item \textbf{Transition Model (T)}: A probability distribution \( T(s'|s, a) \) determining the likelihood of moving to state \( s' \) given the current state \( s \) and action \( a \).
        \item \textbf{Rewards (R)}: A reward function \( R(s, a) \) assigning a numerical value based on the state \( s \) and action \( a \) taken.
        \item \textbf{Policy (Ï€)}: A policy \( \pi(a|s) \) defines the agent's behavior as a mapping from states to actions.
    \end{enumerate}
