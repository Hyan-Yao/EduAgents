\frametitle{Example Use Case and Key Points}
    \begin{block}{Example Use Case}
        Consider a scenario where two agents are learning to complete a maze in which they can either cooperate or compete. You will:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implement IQL, where each agent learns independently.
            \item Implement CDQN, where both can benefit from shared experiences.
        \end{itemize}
        By tracking their performance, you will assess scenarios where cooperation yields higher rewards compared to competition.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Collaboration vs. Competition}: Understanding how agents interact is crucial in MARL settings.
            \item \textbf{Algorithm Selection}: Different environments may require you to choose different algorithms based on your specific goals.
            \item \textbf{Data Analysis}: Visualization (e.g., plotting rewards over time) will be essential for your reportâ€”use libraries like Matplotlib for clarity.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
