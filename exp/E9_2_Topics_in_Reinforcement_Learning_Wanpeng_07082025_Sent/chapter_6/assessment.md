### Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of function approximation in modeling complex functions.
- Recognize the importance of generalization and how it affects performance in machine learning.
- Identify techniques to improve generalization and prevent overfitting in machine learning models.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is function approximation primarily used for?

  A) To create exact models for all functions
  B) To estimate complex functions when precise models are impractical
  C) To generate random functions
  D) To visualize mathematical functions

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Function approximation is used to estimate complex functions when precise models are impractical, making it particularly useful in high-dimensional state spaces.

**Question 2:** Which of the following defines generalization in machine learning?

  A) The ability of a model to memorize training data
  B) The capability to derive rules from data that can be applied to unseen instances
  C) The process of simplifying complex functions
  D) The need to re-train models with new data

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Generalization refers to the ability of a model to perform well on unseen data, which is critical for effective deployment in real-world scenarios.

**Question 3:** What is the purpose of L2 regularization in function approximation?

  A) To increase training speed
  B) To prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights
  C) To ensure the model learns every detail of the training data
  D) To simplify the loss function

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty for large weight values.

**Question 4:** Why is exploration important in reinforcement learning?

  A) To reduce the amount of data required
  B) To ensure the model discovers a broad range of states and actions
  C) To maximize the immediate reward without considering future rewards
  D) To increase the number of states in training

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** A well-structured exploration strategy allows the model to sample a variety of states and actions, which enhances the model's ability to generalize.

### Activities
- Create a simple neural network model to approximate a function. Provide the data, and implement regularization techniques to evaluate its effect on model performance.
