  \frametitle{Introduction to Reinforcement Learning - Overview}
  \begin{block}{Overview of Reinforcement Learning}
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It is inspired by behavioral psychology, where learning occurs through rewards and punishments.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Introduction to Reinforcement Learning - Key Concepts}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Agent}: The learner or decision-maker that takes actions in an environment.
    \item \textbf{Environment}: The context or setting where the agent operates, including everything the agent can interact with.
    \item \textbf{Action}: The choice made by the agent affecting the environment's state.
    \item \textbf{State}: A specific situation or configuration of the environment at a given time.
    \item \textbf{Reward}: A feedback signal received after an action, indicating success based on the desired outcome.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Introduction to Reinforcement Learning - How It Works}
  \begin{block}{How Reinforcement Learning Works}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Trial and Error}: The agent explores actions and learns what works best through feedback.
      \item \textbf{Policy}: A strategy that maps environmental states to actions.
      \item \textbf{Value Function}: Estimates future rewards from each state to guide action selection.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Learning Process}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The agent observes the current state of the environment.
      \item It selects an action based on its policy.
      \item The environment responds, transitioning to a new state and providing a reward.
      \item The agent updates its policy and value function using this information.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Introduction to Reinforcement Learning - Example and Significance}
  \begin{block}{Example: Game Playing}
    In a game like chess:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The player (agent) evaluates different moves (actions) based on the current board layout (state).
      \item The player receives feedback (reward) based on winning or losing the game.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Significance of Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Versatile Applications}: Used in robotics, finance, healthcare, game development, and autonomous vehicles.
      \item \textbf{Real-World Problem Solving}: Addresses complex decision-making problems not directly observable.
      \item \textbf{Continuous Improvement}: Adapts and improves strategies as more experience is gathered.
    \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Actions (A)}: Set of all possible actions the agent can take (e.g., 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right').
        \item \textbf{Transition Model (P)}: Probability of moving from one state to another given an action, denoted as \( P(s'|s,a) \).
        \item \textbf{Reward Function (R)}: Scalar feedback received after transitioning between states (e.g., +10 for goal).
        \item \textbf{Discount Factor (\( \gamma \))}: Value between 0 and 1 that determines future rewards' significance.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts of MDPs}

        [  - ][  - ][  - ]
        [  A ][  - ][  - ]
        \end{verbatim}

        \item \textbf{Environment}: The setting where the agent operates, providing feedback.
        \item \textbf{State (S)}: A specific situation in which the agent finds itself.

    The Q-value, denoted as \( Q(s, a) \), represents the expected utility of taking action \( a \) in state \( s \) while following the optimal policy thereafter.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{The Q-Learning Update Rule}
    The update equation for Q-Learning is given by:

    \begin{equation} 
    Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ R + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
    \end{equation}

    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( \alpha \): Learning rate (controls information update).

        \item Moves can be made in four directions, with rewards in certain cells (e.g., +10 for goals, -1 for obstacles).
        \item The agent explores the grid, updating Q-values based on received rewards.
        \item Over time, the agent learns to navigate more effectively toward goals.

  \frametitle{Exploration vs Exploitation - Introduction}
  \begin{block}{Overview}
  In reinforcement learning (RL), agents must balance two essential strategies:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exploration} - discovering new actions for better rewards.
    \item \textbf{Exploitation} - using known actions to maximize immediate rewards.
  \end{itemize}
  Understanding this trade-off is fundamental for enhancing long-term performance.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Exploration vs Exploitation - The Trade-Off}
  \begin{block}{Trade-Off Insights}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Too much exploration} \\
    Leads to wasted time and resources, as the agent may not utilize what it knows effectively.
    
    \item \textbf{Too much exploitation} \\
    Results in a suboptimal policy, preventing the discovery of better strategies and rewards.
