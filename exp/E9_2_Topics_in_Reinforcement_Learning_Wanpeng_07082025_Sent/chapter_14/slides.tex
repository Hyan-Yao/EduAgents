    \frametitle{Introduction to Week 14: Project Workdays and Feedback Sessions}
    \begin{block}{Overview of Objectives}
        In Week 14, we will focus on enhancing the quality of our group projects through dedicated workdays and structured feedback sessions. Our primary goals are:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Hands-On Collaboration:} Provide teams with designated time to work on their projects, allowing for effective communication, coordination, and collective problem-solving.
            \item \textbf{Peer Review and Feedback:} Encourage constructive peer evaluations to help each group refine their projects, gaining diverse perspectives and suggestions for improvement.
            \item \textbf{Skill Development:} Enhance important skills such as critical thinking, teamwork, and the ability to give and receive feedback.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Concept Explanations}
    \begin{block}{Group Projects}
        Group projects facilitate collaborative learning where students pool their skills and knowledge to achieve a common goal. This collaborative approach mirrors real-world scenarios, preparing students for professional environments where teamwork is essential.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Peer Review}
        Peer review involves evaluating each other's work, allowing team members to share insights and critique constructively. This process enhances learning by encouraging reflection about one's own and others' work.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Time for Collaboration:} Utilize workdays to actively develop your projects. Schedule regular check-ins within your team to ensure everyone is aligned and contributing equally.
        \item \textbf{Providing Constructive Feedback:} Aim for feedback that is specific, actionable, and kind. Instead of saying, "This is bad," try "I think the argument can be strengthened by including recent research on XYZ."
        \item \textbf{Embrace Different Perspectives:} Be open to diverse opinions; sometimes, a fresh perspective can uncover areas for improvement that you might have overlooked.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example Structure for Feedback Sessions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Opening Remarks (5 mins):} Each group introduces their project and outlines main objectives.
        \item \textbf{Project Presentation (10 mins):} Groups present their work—highlighting key features, challenges, and areas seeking feedback.
        \item \textbf{Open Feedback Round (15 mins):} Peers provide insights and suggestions. Encourage all members to engage.
        \item \textbf{Reflection (5 mins):} Teams discuss feedback received and outline next steps.
    \end{enumerate}
