# Final Project Plan Document

## Project Title: Real-World Applications of Reinforcement Learning in Robotics

### Description
This collaborative final project focuses on the application of reinforcement learning (RL) methodologies to real-world robotics problems. Students will work in teams to design, analyze, and implement solutions using RL algorithms, fostering critical thinking and practical application of course concepts.

### Objectives
1. Describe core RL concepts as they pertain to robotics.
2. Evaluate various RL algorithms based on their applicability to selected problems.
3. Apply RL methods to engineer solutions for practical challenges in robotics.
4. Conduct thorough research utilizing academic literature and real-world data on chosen topics.
5. Enhance collaborative skills through teamwork and communication.
