**[Advance to Frame 4]**  
"Next, let’s outline the steps involved in the peer review process to understand how it flows. 

1. **Preparation**: The initial step involves authors distributing their work to their peers for review. This can also include providing specific guidelines on what they would like feedback on.

2. **Reviewing**: Reviewers then assess the work, taking notes on strengths and areas for improvement. This step is crucial because it sets the stage for the next phase.

3. **Feedback**: After reviewing, reviewers provide written feedback that highlights both commendations and suggestions for improvement. This is often where constructive criticism comes into play.

4. **Revision**: Now it’s the authors’ turn. They revise their work based on the feedback received to enhance their contributions. This iteration is an important part of the process.

5. **Final Evaluation**: The final step is another round of reviewing to ensure that the adjustments made truly enhance the quality of the project before its submission or presentation. This final check reinforces the quality assurance aspect we discussed earlier.

**[Advance to Frame 5]**  
"In conclusion, the peer review process is not merely a formality; it’s an essential component of collaborative AI projects. It fosters quality, encourages learning and critical skill development, and promotes professional growth among team members. By engaging in this process, teams can push themselves to innovate while maintaining high standards, which ultimately leads to more successful project outcomes.
