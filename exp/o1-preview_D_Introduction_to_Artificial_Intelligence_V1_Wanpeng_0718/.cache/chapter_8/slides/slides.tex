\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Data Integrity Issues}
    
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Data integrity is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of data used in artificial intelligence systems. 
        We will explore four main types of data integrity issues:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Accuracy
            \item Consistency
            \item Completeness
            \item Timeliness
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Data Integrity Issues - Accuracy}
    
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Accuracy refers to how closely data values align with the true values or real-world phenomena they represent.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Inaccurate data can lead to poor decision-making and skewed analysis results.
        \item Common sources of inaccuracies include human errors, outdated information, and sensor malfunctions.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Consider a dataset that records the temperatures of various cities. If the temperature for New York City is recorded as 150Â°F, this data point is inaccurate and would mislead analyses on weather trends.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Data Integrity Issues - Consistency}
    
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Consistency refers to the uniformity of data across different datasets or within the same dataset over time.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Inconsistent data can arise when data is entered or formatted differently in various places.
        \item It can result in conflicting information, impacting reliability and user trust.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        If one dataset indicates that a customer is from "New York" while another says "NY," these inconsistencies can create confusion in customer analysis processes.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Data Integrity Issues - Completeness and Timeliness}
    
    \begin{block}{Completeness}
        Completeness measures whether all required data is present in a dataset; it evaluates whether the dataset is filled with all necessary entries.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Missing data can lead to incomplete analyses, affecting the outcomes of machine learning models.
            \item Completeness is often assessed by identifying missing fields or records.
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{block}{Example}
            In a healthcare dataset, if patient medical histories are only partially recorded (e.g., missing allergy information), it can lead to ineffective treatment recommendations based on incomplete information.
        \end{block}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Timeliness}
        Timeliness refers to the relevance of the data in relation to the current context or period. Data must be up-to-date to be valuable.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Stale data can lead to erroneous conclusions or ineffective actions, especially in fast-moving scenarios like finance or social media.
            \item Regular updates and audits are essential to maintain timeliness.
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{block}{Example}
            If a dataset containing stock prices is updated only once a week, it may not accurately reflect current market conditions, leading to poor investment decisions.
        \end{block}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}
