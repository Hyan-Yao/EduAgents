    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Rule-Based Approaches}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Rule-based NLP relies on predefined linguistic rules and heuristics to process language.

        \item Limited adaptability to new language patterns.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        A grammar-checking tool that identifies subject-verb agreement. E.g., 
        \textit{If the subject is singular, the verb must also be singular.}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        While effective for specific tasks, rule-based approaches struggle with ambiguity and diversity in language.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Machine learning methods like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes are effective in various NLP tasks.
    \end{block}
    \begin{equation}
        P(Class|Text) = \frac{P(Text|Class) \times P(Class)}{P(Text)}
    \end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Deep Learning Approaches}
    \begin{block}{Definition}

    \frametitle{Challenges in NLP - Ambiguity}
    \begin{block}{Ambiguity}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item **Definition**: Words and sentences can have multiple meanings, leading to confusion in interpretation.
            \item **Types of Ambiguity**:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item **Lexical Ambiguity**: A single word can have different meanings. 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Example: “bank” can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river.
                \end{itemize}
                \item **Syntactic Ambiguity**: The structure of a sentence can lead to different interpretations. 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Example: “I saw the man with a telescope” could mean using a telescope to see the man or the man possessing a telescope.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            \item **Implication**: Models must disambiguate meanings based on context to ensure accurate understanding.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Challenges in NLP - Context Understanding}
    \begin{block}{Context Understanding}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item **Importance of Context**: The meaning of a word or phrase often depends on surrounding text, prior sentences, and real-world knowledge.
            \item **Example**: In “He went to the bank to fish,” context helps to determine that "bank" refers to a location for fishing.
            \item **Challenges**:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item **Coreference Resolution**: Identifying when different words refer to the same entity.
                \item **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding tone can be affected by context (e.g., detecting sarcasm).
