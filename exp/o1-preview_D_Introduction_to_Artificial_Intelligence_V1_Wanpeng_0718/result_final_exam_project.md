# Final Project Plan: AI Solutions for Real-World Problems

## Description
This project is designed to replace the traditional final exam for the "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" course. It emphasizes collaboration, critical thinking, and the application of AI methodologies to solve real-world problems. Students will form teams to identify and propose AI-driven solutions to specific societal issues.

## Objectives
- To apply AI methodologies to real-world problems.
- To foster teamwork and enhance communication skills.
- To conduct thorough research and analysis relevant to a chosen problem.
- To reflect on the ethical implications of AI applications.
- To develop presentation skills through peer review and feedback.
