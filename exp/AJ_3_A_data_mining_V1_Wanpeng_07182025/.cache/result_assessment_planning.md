### Submission Logistics
- All submissions through **Canvas LMS**.
- Code must be runnable without errors; documentation should clarify methodology for reproducibility.
- Presentations may be recorded and submitted for evaluation.

---

### Ethical Considerations and Real-World Applications
- Integrate discussions on ethical implications throughout the semester.
- Weekly assignments will include written reflections on ethics in data mining.
- Capstone projects will require a segment analyzing ethical implications and responsible data practices.

---

### Final Project Cumulative Assessment
- The capstone project synthesizes course knowledge, requiring students to tackle a real-world data issue and present findings with ethical considerations.
