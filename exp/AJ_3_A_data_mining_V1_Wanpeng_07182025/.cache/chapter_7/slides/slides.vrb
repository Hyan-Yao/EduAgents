\frametitle{Example Case and Discussion Points}
    \textbf{Example Case:} Predictive Model for Customer Churn
    \begin{itemize}
        \item After training the model, the accuracy is 85%.
        \item However, the recall is only 60%, indicating challenges in identifying customers likely to churn.
        \item Possible improvements: Adjusting thresholds, exploring different algorithms, or balancing class distributions.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Discussion Points:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Challenge: What difficulties have you faced in validating models? How did you overcome them?
        \item Insights: Can you share an instance where a specific metric (like precision vs. recall) redirected your model validation strategy?
        \item Tools: What tools or libraries have you found useful for model evaluation in your projects?
    \end{itemize}
