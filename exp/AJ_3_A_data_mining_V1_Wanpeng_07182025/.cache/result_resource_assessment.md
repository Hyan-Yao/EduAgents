Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource and Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: "AJ_3_A_data_mining"

## Faculty Expertise Requirements

### Subject Matter Expertise
- Faculty should possess:
  - Advanced knowledge of data mining techniques, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms.
  - Ideally hold a master's or PhD in Computer Science, Data Science, Statistics, or related fields.
  - Practical experience with Python and R, essential for conducting hands-on exercises.

### Teaching Methodology
- Instructors must:
  - Utilize varied instructional strategies tailored to technical subjects, incorporating project-based and experiential learning methods.
  - Facilitate group projects and engage students in discussions about ethical considerations and real-world applications of data mining.

## Necessary Computing Resources

### Hardware Requirements
- Minimum specifications for student computers:
  - Quad-core CPU and 16GB RAM to efficiently handle data mining software and large datasets.
- Ensure an adequate number of working computers in lab settings to facilitate hands-on learning.

### Software Requirements
- **Core Software**: 
  - Students should have access to:
    - Python (with packages: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) and R.
    - IDEs such as Jupyter Notebook and RStudio.
- **Visualization Tools**:
  - Additional tools like Tableau or Power BI for enhanced data visualization training may require financial investment or licenses.

### Installation and Access
- Pre-installation of required software on student computers or ensure access to cloud-based platforms to facilitate prompt course commencement.
- Faculty must be capable of troubleshooting technical issues or there should be dedicated IT support available.

## Scheduling Constraints

### Course Timetable
- Align course schedules:
  - Consider faculty availability and student preferences to optimize participation.
  - Option for blended scheduling that incorporates both live and asynchronous lab sessions.

### Facilities
- Classrooms/labs must be equipped with:
  - High-speed internet access, projection capabilities, and comfortable seating for extended instruction periods.
- Define maximum student capacities for lab sessions based on optimal faculty-to-student ratios for effective learning.

## Additional Constraints

### Course Coherence
- Feedback indicates need to:
  - Consolidate repetitive content to enhance course cohesion and maintain student engagement.

### Accessibility and Pre-requisites
- Clarify and communicate required background knowledge or skills for prospective students, such as familiarity with programming concepts or prior coursework in statistics/data analysis.

### Teaching Assistance
- Assessment of TA availability for practical lab support:
  - Well-prepared TAs can significantly enhance learning experiences by providing additional student assistance.

### Feedback Mechanism
- Establish ongoing channels for student feedback:
  - Effective for gathering insights on course delivery, resource adequacy, and content clarity for continuous improvement.

## Recommendations

- **Faculty Recruitment**: Target faculty with a mix of theoretical knowledge and industry experience to draw connections between academic content and real-world applications.
  
- **Tech Setup**: Validate the functionality of technology (hardware, software, internet) prior to course commencement.

- **Course Structure Adjustment**: Revise the syllabus to include clearer accessibility guidelines and streamline content to eliminate redundancy.

- **Engagement and Evaluation**: Implement processes for regular student feedback to adjust pacing, teaching strategies, and overall course structure as required to promote an optimal learning environment.
