## Course Description
This course introduces data mining techniques, including classification, clustering, and association rule mining. It emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ethical considerations in data practice. Students will apply theoretical knowledge through hands-on exercises and a capstone project that demonstrates practical applications.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python or R.
- Fundamental statistical concepts.
- Comfort with algebra and linear algebra.
- Familiarity with data handling and manipulation.

## Course Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing**  
   Demonstrate the ability to clean and preprocess datasets with at least 90% accuracy using Python or R.

2. **Data Mining Techniques**  
   Identify and differentiate three data mining techniques (classification, clustering, and association rule mining) and apply them to two real-world datasets, achieving 80% accuracy.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Conduct EDA to summarize dataset characteristics and present findings using data visualization techniques scoring 80% in peer assessments.

4. **Model Evaluation and Validation**  
   Design and implement model evaluation strategies achieving predefined success metrics (e.g., 75% accuracy using cross-validation).

5. **Ethical Considerations in Data Mining**  
   Critically discuss and reflect on three ethical implications of data mining through written assignments and presentations.

6. **Real-World Application and Case Studies**  
   Develop and present a capstone project that encompasses the data mining process, leading to actionable insights.

## Required Readings
1. **Primary Textbook:**  
   "Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques" by Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber, and Jian Pei (4th Edition).
2. **Supplementary Readings:**  
   - "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney.
   - Selected academic articles and case studies, which will be provided throughout the course.
