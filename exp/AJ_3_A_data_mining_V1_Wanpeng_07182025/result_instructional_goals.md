Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

### Learning Objectives for "AJ_3_A_data_mining"

1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing**
   - Demonstrate the ability to clean and preprocess datasets with at least 90% accuracy using tools such as Python or R.

2. **Data Mining Techniques**
   - Identify and differentiate at least three data mining techniques (classification, clustering, and association rule mining) and apply them to a minimum of two real-world datasets, achieving specified performance thresholds (e.g., 80% accuracy).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis to summarize dataset characteristics and present findings using data visualization techniques that score at least 80% in peer assessments for clarity and effectiveness.

4. **Model Evaluation and Validation**
   - Design and implement model evaluation strategies that achieve predefined success metrics (e.g., 75% accuracy using cross-validation and confusion matrices).

5. **Ethical Considerations in Data Mining**
   - Critically discuss and reflect on at least three ethical implications of data mining practices through written assignments or presentations, demonstrating awareness of data privacy and algorithmic bias.

6. **Real-World Application and Case Studies**
   - Develop and present a capstone project that encompasses the data mining process, leading to actionable insights with real-world applications, demonstrating integration across all learned concepts.
