    \frametitle{Data Mining Techniques Recap - Overview}
    Data mining is the process of discovering patterns and extracting valuable information from large sets of data. It involves the application of various techniques, categorized into three main types:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Classification}
        \item \textbf{Clustering}
        \item \textbf{Association Rule Mining}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Data Mining Techniques Recap - Classification}
    
    \textbf{Definition:} Classification is a supervised learning technique aimed at predicting the categorical label of new data points based on past observations.
    
    \textbf{How It Works:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Training Phase:} Models are trained on a labeled dataset (features with known categories).
        \item \textbf{Prediction Phase:} The trained model predicts the category for new, unseen data.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \textbf{Example:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Email Spam Detection: Classifying emails as 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' based on features.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Common Algorithms:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Decision Trees
        \item Support Vector Machines (SVM)
