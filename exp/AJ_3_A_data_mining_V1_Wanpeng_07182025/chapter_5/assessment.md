**Question 1:** What is a major benefit of using clustering techniques in data mining?

  A) They eliminate the need for data analysis.
  B) They help identify patterns and groupings in large datasets.
  C) They are the only technique available for data segmentation.
  D) They simplify all forms of data processing.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Clustering techniques specifically help to identify patterns and groupings, which is a core aspect of data mining.

**Question 2:** Which clustering technique requires the user to specify the number of clusters beforehand?

  A) DBSCAN
  B) Mean Shift
  C) Hierarchical Clustering
  D) K-Means Clustering

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** K-Means Clustering requires the user to decide on the number of clusters (K) before executing the algorithm.

**Question 3:** How does DBSCAN handle outliers?

  A) It treats all points as part of clusters.
  B) It ignores dense regions.
  C) It marks points in low-density regions as outliers.
  D) It forces them into existing clusters.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** DBSCAN identifies points in low-density regions and labels them as outliers while grouping dense areas into clusters.

**Question 4:** Which technique is best suited for datasets with irregularly shaped clusters?

  A) K-Means
  B) Hierarchical Clustering
  C) DBSCAN
  D) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** DBSCAN is effective for finding clusters of irregular shapes and is robust against noise.

### Activities
- Create a case study where you apply different clustering techniques to the same dataset and analyze how the results vary based on the chosen technique.

### Discussion Questions
- How might the choice of a clustering technique impact data interpretation in various real-world scenarios?
- Discuss a scenario where clustering could lead to misleading conclusions if not applied correctly.
