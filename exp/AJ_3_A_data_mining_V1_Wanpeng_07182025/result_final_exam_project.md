Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan: Capstone Data Mining Project

---

### Project Description
The capstone project will serve as the comprehensive final assessment, allowing students to apply their knowledge of data mining techniques in a real-world scenario. Students will work collaboratively (in groups of 3-5) on a project that requires them to select a relevant dataset, perform data preprocessing, apply various data mining techniques, analyze the results, and present their findings, including ethical implications.

---

### Learning Objectives
1. Data Understanding and Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess selected datasets.
2. Data Mining Techniques: Apply at least three different data mining techniques, achieving the required accuracy.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA and present findings effectively.
4. Model Evaluation and Validation: Implement evaluation strategies that meet predefined metrics.
5. Ethical Considerations: Discuss ethical implications of data mining practices.
6. Real-World Application: Develop actionable insights from the project findings.

### Submission Formats
- All project components must be submitted through **Canvas** in the specified formats.
- Ensure all code is executable and includes clarifications of methodology for reproducibility.
- Peer feedback must be submitted for evaluation based on provided structured criteria.

---

### Ethical Considerations
Students are expected to address ethical implications of their project, including topics such as:
- Data privacy
- Algorithmic bias
- Responsible data handling practices

A dedicated section discussing these issues in the final report is mandatory.

---

### Academic Integrity
- Adherence to university policies on academic honesty is required.
- Instances of plagiarism or unethical behaviors will result in disciplinary actions.
- Collaboration is encouraged, but final submissions must reflect original work and insights from the group.

---

### Final Thoughts
Engage actively with your team and ensure integration of ethical considerations within your project process. This project will synthesize your knowledge and demonstrate an understanding of data mining processes and implications. Good luck!
