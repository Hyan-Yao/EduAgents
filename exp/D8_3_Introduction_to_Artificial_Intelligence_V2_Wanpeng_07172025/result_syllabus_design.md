# Course Syllabus: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (D8_3)

## Course Overview
This course provides an introduction to the principles and applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on both technical skills and ethical considerations. Students will explore the fundamental concepts, algorithms, and societal implications of AI technologies over fifteen weeks, culminating in a project that demonstrates their understanding and proficiency in the subject.

## Course Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. **Knowledge Acquisition**: Define and explain at least 10 key AI terms and illustrate each with current technology examples.
2. **Technical Application**: Successfully implement at least four AI algorithms in programming assignments, including one addressing a specific ethical concern.
3. **Ethical Evaluation**: Analyze and discuss two ethical dilemmas in AI using established frameworks such as the IEEE Global Initiative, including ethical implications in each case.
4. **Case Study Analysis**: Critique and present findings from two different AI case studies, highlighting unique challenges and proposing realistic solutions based on evidence.
5. **Effective Communication**: Deliver a presentation on an AI project tailored for both specialist and non-specialist audiences, including a technical appendix.
6. **Collaborative Abilities**: Actively participate in structured peer evaluations, supporting group accountability and individual performance feedback.
