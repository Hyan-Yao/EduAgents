    \frametitle{Logic in Knowledge Representation}
    \begin{block}{Introduction to Formal Logic in AI}
        Formal logic is a fundamental component of knowledge representation in AI. It provides a structured framework to model and reason about information systematically. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Define relationships between entities
            \item Draw conclusions
            \item Represent facts in a machine-understandable way
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Logic in Knowledge Representation}
    
    \begin{block}{1. Propositional Logic}
        \textbf{Definition:} Deals with propositions that can be either \textit{true} or \textit{false}. It uses logical connectives to combine these propositions.
        
        \textbf{Key Connectives:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item AND ( $\land$ ): True if both propositions are true.
            \item OR ( $\lor$ ): True if at least one proposition is true.
            \item NOT ( $\neg$ ): Inverts the truth value of a proposition.
            \item IMPLIES ( $\rightarrow$ ): True unless a true proposition implies a false one.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \textbf{Example:}
        \[
        P \rightarrow Q \quad \text{where } P: \text{"It is raining."}, \quad Q: \text{"The ground is wet."}
        \]
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Logic in Knowledge Representation (cont.)}
    
    \begin{block}{2. Predicate Logic}
        \textbf{Definition:} Extends propositional logic by dealing with predicates and allows for more expressive statements.
        
        \textbf{Components:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Predicates: Functions returning true or false (e.g., Wet(x) means "x is wet").
            \item Quantifiers:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Universal Quantifier ( $\forall$ ): Property holds for all elements.
                    \item Existential Quantifier ( $\exists$ ): At least one element satisfies the property.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \textbf{Example:}
        \[
        \forall x (W(x) \rightarrow F(x)) \quad \text{meaning "All dogs are friendly."}
        \]
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Advantages of Using Logic for Knowledge Representation}

        \item \textbf{Clarity and Precision:} Ensures unambiguous definitions of relationships and facts.
        \item \textbf{Powerful Reasoning:} Allows deriving new knowledge through inference rules.
        \item \textbf{Foundation for Automated Reasoning:} Enables logical deductions automatically.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Remember}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Both propositional and predicate logic are essential for structuring knowledge.
        \item Propositional logic is simpler and deals with whole statements.
        \item Predicate logic allows for detailed relations within those statements.
        \item Choice of logic affects expressiveness and complexity of knowledge representation.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Ethical Implications - Part I}
    \begin{block}{1. Fairness}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Fairness in AI involves treating all individuals and groups equally, devoid of bias.
            \item \textbf{Importance}: Unfair algorithms can cause discrimination in critical areas like hiring, lending, and law enforcement.
            \item \textbf{Example}: A biased hiring algorithm may favor candidates from specific backgrounds, thus perpetuating inequality.
            \item \textbf{Mitigation Strategies}: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Implement bias detection tools.
                \item Utilize diverse training datasets for balanced representation.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \frametitle{Key Ethical Implications - Part II}
    \begin{block}{2. Accountability}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Accountability means designers and operators are responsible for AI decision-making processes.
            \item \textbf{Importance}: Clear accountability is essential for addressing societal impacts and negative outcomes from AI technologies.
            \item \textbf{Example}: In the case of a self-driving car accident, who is responsible: the manufacturer, software developer, or owner?
            \item \textbf{Mitigation Strategies}: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Establish clear regulations for accountability in AI applications.
                \item Foster a culture of ethical responsibility among AI practitioners.
