    \frametitle{Algorithmic Bias}
    % Overview of what algorithmic bias is and its significance in AI systems.
    \begin{block}{What is Algorithmic Bias?}
        \textbf{Definition}: Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and unfair discrimination embedded within AI systems, often resulting from the data used to train these models. When AI algorithms make decisions or predictions, they may reflect prejudices that exist in society, leading to unequal treatment of different groups.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{How Does Algorithmic Bias Manifest?}
    % Explanation of manifesting forms of algorithmic bias.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Data Bias}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Biases present in training data can lead to skewed results.
                \item \textit{Example}: If a facial recognition system is primarily trained on images of light-skinned individuals, it may struggle to accurately identify dark-skinned faces.
            \end{itemize}
    
        \item \textbf{Model Bias}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Design choices and assumptions embedded within algorithm development can introduce bias.
                \item \textit{Example}: An algorithm designed to predict recidivism rates may overemphasize certain demographic factors, leading to disproportionate predictions for minority groups.
            \end{itemize}
    
        \item \textbf{Feedback Loops}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Algorithms can perpetuate existing bias over time through reinforcement.
                \item \textit{Example}: If an AI model continuously finds that certain groups are less likely to receive loan approvals, it may reduce opportunities for these groups, compounding the bias.

    \frametitle{Ethical Concerns and Biases}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Algorithmic Bias}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition:} Bias occurs when an algorithm produces systematically prejudiced results due to erroneous assumptions in the machine learning process.
            \item \textbf{Manifestation:} FRT tends to struggle with accurately identifying individuals from marginalized groups, particularly women and people of color.
            \item \textbf{Example:} A study by MIT Media Lab (2018) showed 34\% error rates for darker-skinned women compared to less than 1\% for lighter-skinned men.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Privacy Violations}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Concerns:} Continuous surveillance raises significant privacy issues; many users may not consent to their images being analyzed.
            \item \textbf{Example:} In 2019, San Francisco banned city use of FRT due to concerns about monitoring without consent.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Ethical Dilemmas in Autonomous Vehicles}
    \textbf{Definition of Ethical Dilemma}: A situation involving conflicting moral principles, making it challenging to choose ethically aligned actions.

    \begin{block}{Key Dilemmas}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Trolley Problem Analogy}: An AV must decide between two harmful outcomes (e.g., hitting a pedestrian or swerving into a barrier).
            \item \textbf{Value of Lives}: How should an AV weigh lives? Should it prioritize passengers, pedestrians, or specific demographics?
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

        \item \textbf{Collision Avoidance}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Situation}: An AV must choose between crashing into a wall (risking the passenger's life) or swerving into pedestrians.
                \item \textit{Ethical Question}: Which choice is more defensible? Is it permissible to sacrifice the few to save the many?
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Emergency Response}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Situation}: Should an AV communicate with emergency services first or prioritize saving its occupants?
                \item \textit{Ethical Question}: What does the responsibility of an autonomous system entail in emergencies?
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{3. Ethical Frameworks for Analysis}
    Various ethical frameworks can be applied to navigate dilemmas:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Utilitarianism}: Aim for the greatest good for the greatest number; actions should minimize overall harm.
        \item \textbf{Deontological Ethics}: Focus on the morality of actions, adhering to strict moral rules, like never intentionally harming a human.
        \item \textbf{Virtue Ethics}: Centers on character; an AV should embody virtues like compassion, though challenging to program.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{4. Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Transparency}: AVs must explain decision-making processes to build public trust.
        \item \textbf{Accountability}: Determine who is responsible in an accident involving an AV (manufacturer, programmer, or owner).
        \item \textbf{Public Policy}: Regulations should guide the ethical deployment of AVs and align ethical decisions with societal values.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    The design and deployment of autonomous vehicles require careful consideration of ethical dilemmas. As technology progresses, continuous dialogue over ethical frameworks is essential to ensure safety and societal alignment.
