\frametitle{Types of Search Strategies - Informed Search Strategies}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Informed search strategies, also known as heuristic search strategies, have additional information (heuristics) that estimates the cost from the current node to the goal.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example Algorithms:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{A* Search}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Combines the cost to reach the node $g(n)$ and the estimated cost to the goal $h(n)$, optimizing the search.
                    \item \textbf{Formula:}
                    \begin{equation}
                    f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
                    \end{equation}
                    \item \textit{Characteristics:} Complete and optimal, given that the heuristic is admissible.
                    \item \textit{Use Case:} Route finding in maps, such as GPS navigation.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Greedy Best-First Search}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Expands the node that appears to be closest to the goal, according to a heuristic.
                    \item \textit{Characteristics:} Faster but not guaranteed to find the optimal path.
                    \item \textit{Use Case:} Games and puzzle-solving where a quick solution is preferred.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
