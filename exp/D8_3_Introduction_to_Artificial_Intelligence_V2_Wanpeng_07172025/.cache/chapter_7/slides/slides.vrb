    \begin{block}{Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Description}: The simplest type of artificial neural network where connections between nodes do not form cycles.
            \item \textbf{Structure}: Composed of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer.
            \item \textbf{Use Cases}: Ideal for basic regression and classification tasks (e.g., image recognition).
            \item \textbf{Example}: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and age.

    \textbf{Key Point:} Each layer transforms the input data through weighted connections and activation functions.
