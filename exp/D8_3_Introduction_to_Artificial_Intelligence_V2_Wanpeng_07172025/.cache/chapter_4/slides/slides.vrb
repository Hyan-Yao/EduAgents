\frametitle{Key Concepts in Knowledge Representation - Key Takeaways}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The effectiveness of AI systems hinges on how knowledge is represented and how reasoning is performed.
        \item Different forms of representation impact the efficiency and capability of reasoning processes.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Propositional Logic Example}
        Representation of knowledge:
        \begin{equation}
            P: \text{"It is raining."} \\
            Q: \text{"The ground is wet."} \\
            P \implies Q \quad (\text{If it is raining, then the ground is wet.})
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Conclusion:} Understanding these core concepts is essential for exploring deeper into logic in knowledge representation in AI systems.
