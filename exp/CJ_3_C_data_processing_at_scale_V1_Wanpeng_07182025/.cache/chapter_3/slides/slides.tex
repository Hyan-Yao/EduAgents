\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Interpreting Statistical Results - Key Guidelines}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Understand the Statistical Output:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{P-value:} Indicates the likelihood of observing results under the null hypothesis (p-value < 0.05 suggests significance).
            \item \textbf{Confidence Interval (CI):} A range likely to contain the true parameter value (e.g., a 95\% CI).
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Contextualize the Findings:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Keep the research questions and practical significance in mind.
            \item Consider the effect size and sample size appropriateness.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Avoid Common Misinterpretations:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Causation vs. Correlation:} Correlation does not imply causation.
            \item \textit{Overfitting:} Beware of overly complex models fitting noise instead of trends.

        \item 95\% CI = (5, 10) (suggests a 5 to 10 mmHg reduction)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Formulas to Remember:}
    \begin{equation}
        \text{P-value} = P(\text{observed data or more extreme} | H_0 \text{ is true})
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
        \text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm Z \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right)
    \end{equation}
