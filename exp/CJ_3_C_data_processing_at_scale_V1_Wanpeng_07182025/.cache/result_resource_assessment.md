Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: "CJ_3_C_data_processing_at_scale"

## 1. Faculty Expertise Requirements
- **Subject Matter Expertise**
  - Faculty must possess strong backgrounds in data processing, statistics, and analytics, preferably with experience in the criminal justice sector.
  - Knowledge of ethical data handling practices and legal frameworks (e.g., GDPR) is essential.
  
- **Technical Skills**
  - Proficiency in data processing tools and languages such as R, Python, and data visualization platforms like Tableau is mandatory.
  - Ability to effectively teach these technologies to students is crucial.

- **Interdisciplinary Knowledge**
  - Experience in working with interdisciplinary teams, particularly in social sciences or criminal justice, enhances collaborative course dynamics.

## 2. Necessary Computing Resources
- **Hardware Requirements**
  - Desktops/laptops must meet minimum specifications for analytical software operation.
  - Consideration for university-supported laptops for student equity in Access.

- **Laboratory/Studio Access**
  - Access to dedicated computer labs equipped with the necessary software for practical sessions and collaborative work.

## 3. Software Requirements
- **Data Processing & Analysis Tools**
  - Required software includes:
    - **R and RStudio** for statistical analysis.
    - **Python** and relevant libraries (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy) for data processing.
    - **Tableau** for data visualization.
  
- **Licensing**
  - Ensure necessary licenses for all required software are secured beforehand.
  - Explore open-source alternatives if budget limitations arise.

- **Training Resources**
  - Provide supplementary training materials or online courses for students to familiarize themselves with tools prior to practical sessions.

## 4. Scheduling Considerations
- **Class Structure**
  - Schedule uninterrupted blocks for hands-on lab sessions, allowing for full engagement in practical activities.
  
- **TA Coordination**
  - Consider TA availability in the scheduling process. Define TA responsibilities to avoid overburdening and ensure alignment with course objectives.

- **Class Format and Timing**
  - A hybrid model where lectures are delivered online with in-person labs periodically may maximize flexibility and collaborative effectiveness.

## 5. Facility Limitations
- **Space for Group Work**
  - Collaborative spaces or classrooms conducive to interdisciplinary projects need to be ensured.
  
- **Access to Resources**
  - Confirm reliable internet connectivity and necessary access to online databases or data repositories in all learning environments.

## 6. Additional Considerations
- **Academic Policies**
  - Develop a comprehensive policy guide to accompany the syllabus, clearly articulating grading, late submission guidelines, and integrity expectations.

- **Clarification of Background Knowledge**
  - Specify any required background skills or recommendations for prior coursework related to statistics or programming to foster preparedness.

## 7. Feedback Integration
- **Syllabus Adjustments**
  - Implement feedback for syllabus clarity regarding prerequisites and academic policies.
  - Articulate expectations for late assignments and academic integrity in a transparent manner.

## Conclusion
The effective delivery of "CJ_3_C_data_processing_at_scale" requires a thorough understanding and thoughtful planning of resources and constraints. With the outlined measures focused on faculty training, infrastructure, and policy clarity, the course can create a robust educational experience for students while preparing them for practical applications in the criminal justice field.
