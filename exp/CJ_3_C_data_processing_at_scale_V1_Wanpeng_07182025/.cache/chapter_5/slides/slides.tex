        \item \textbf{Public Trust}: Surveillance and data collection can undermine community trust if not transparent.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Case Studies Overview:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Los Angeles (PredPol)}: Crime reduction, scrutiny over racial profiling.
        \item \textbf{Chicago (Strategic Subject List)}: Violent crime predictions raised privacy discussions.

    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations in Predictive Policing - Introduction}
    Predictive policing employs algorithms to analyze vast amounts of data to predict where crimes are likely to occur. While this can enhance law enforcement effectiveness, it raises significant ethical concerns.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations in Predictive Policing - Key Implications}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Bias and Discrimination}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Predictive models can perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases in law enforcement data.
                \item \textit{Example}: Historical crime data may lead to over-policing marginalized communities.
                \item \textbf{Key Point}: Continuous evaluation and adjustment of algorithms are essential.
            \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Privacy Concerns}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Use of personal data raises questions about individual privacy and consent.
                \item \textit{Example}: Surveillance data can infer personal behavior, leading to unwarranted surveillance.
                \item \textbf{Key Point}: Clear guidelines should govern data collection and usage.
