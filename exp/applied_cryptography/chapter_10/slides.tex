    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Protects Sensitive Data}: 
        Cryptographic keys are essential for encrypting and decrypting data. If a key is compromised, unauthorized parties can access sensitive information, leading to data breaches.
        
        \item \textbf{Maintains Trust}: 
        Effective key management helps maintain trust among users. Organizations that can assure their customers of strong cryptographic practices are likely to build a loyal customer base.
        
        \item \textbf{Regulatory Compliance}: 
        Many industries are subject to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) requiring strong data protection measures, including proper key management. Non-compliance can result in substantial fines.
        
        \item \textbf{Facilitates Cryptographic Operations}:

    \frametitle{Introduction to Key Management - Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Lifecycle Management}: 
        Key management encompasses the entire lifecycle of a keyâ€”from creation to retirement. Each stage needs secure protocols to ensure the key remains confidential and untampered.
        
        \item \textbf{Types of Keys}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Symmetric Keys}: The same key is used for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES key management).
            \item \textbf{Asymmetric Keys}: Uses a pair of keys (public and private), such as RSA, where the public key encrypts and only the private key can decrypt.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Common Key Management Practices}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Key Generation}: Keys must be generated securely using algorithms with high entropy.
            \item \textbf{Key Distribution}: Ensure the key is transmitted securely, using techniques such as transport layer security (TLS).
            \item \textbf{Key Storage}: Store keys in secure hardware or use encryption to prevent unauthorized access.
            \item \textbf{Key Rotation}: Regularly changing keys limits risks associated with key compromise.
