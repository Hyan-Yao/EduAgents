Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

### Learning Objectives for "Applied Cryptography"

1. **Understanding Cryptographic Principles**:
   - Define and explain foundational concepts of cryptography, including confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.
   - Identify and compare various cryptographic algorithms (symmetric, asymmetric, hash functions) and articulate their applications in securing data.

2. **Cryptographic Protocols and Standards**:
   - Describe key cryptographic protocols (TLS/SSL, IPsec) and analyze their application in real-world secure communications.
   - Evaluate industry standards (NIST, ISO/IEC) that govern the use of cryptography in information security and assess the effectiveness of various protocols in differing contexts.

3. **Implementing Cryptographic Solutions**:
   - Demonstrate proficiency in implementing cryptographic algorithms using specific programming languages (e.g., Python, Java) and libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, hashlib).
   - Develop and present projects that integrate cryptographic solutions into software systems to meet specific security requirements.

4. **Evaluating Cryptographic Risk**:
   - Conduct risk assessments of cryptographic systems, identifying vulnerabilities and attack vectors (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks).
   - Formulate and recommend risk management plans that incorporate best practices for key management and secure implementation of cryptographic solutions.

5. **Adapting to Evolving Technologies**:
   - Analyze current trends in applied cryptography, such as quantum cryptography and blockchain technology, and evaluate their implications for information security.
   - Participate in hands-on labs or workshops that involve the experimentation of new cryptographic technologies and methodologies.

6. **Ethical and Legal Considerations**:
   - Discuss the ethical implications and legal frameworks surrounding cryptography, including privacy laws and compliance requirements.
   - Evaluate case studies of cryptographic successes and failures, understanding the socio-technical context of employed cryptographic practices, and analyze the impact of cultural differences on security practices.
