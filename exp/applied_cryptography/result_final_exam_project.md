Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan: "Secure Communication System Development"

## Project Description
Students will collaboratively design and implement a secure software application that showcases the application of cryptographic methods discussed throughout the course. The project will culminate in a comprehensive report and presentation demonstrating mastery of cryptographic principles, protocols, and risk management strategies.

## Objectives
- Apply cryptographic methods to develop a secure communication application.
- Demonstrate understanding of symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hash functions, and risk management strategies.
- Collaborate effectively within teams to produce a working software application and analytical report.
- Strengthen presentation and communication skills through a formal project presentation.
