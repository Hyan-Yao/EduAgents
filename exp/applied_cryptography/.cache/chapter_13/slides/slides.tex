                \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64

key = 'ThisIsASecretKey'  # Key must be 16/24/32 bytes long
cipher = AES.new(key.encode('utf-8'), AES.MODE_EAX)

plaintext = 'Hello, World!'
ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(plaintext.encode('utf-8'))
print("Encrypted:", base64.b64encode(ciphertext).decode('utf-8'))
                \end{lstlisting}
