    \begin{block}{Definition}
        A Man-in-the-Middle attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and relays messages between two parties.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{How it Works:}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Interception:} Attacker places themselves between the client and server (e.g., rogue Wi-Fi).
                \item \textbf{Decryption:} Attacker decrypts, alters, and re-encrypts messages.
            \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Example:} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Alice sends a confidential message to Bob.
                \item An attacker intercepts, reads, and modifies it.

    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{How it Works:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Attacker listens and saves valid data packets.
                \item Later, they resend packets to imitate a legitimate request.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item User sends a transaction request to transfer funds.
                \item An attacker captures and later resends the request to repeat the action.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Points:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Use nonces or timestamps to counter replay attacks.
