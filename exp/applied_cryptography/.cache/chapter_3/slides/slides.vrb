\frametitle{Security Features of RSA - Key Vulnerabilities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Size and Strength:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Security increases with key size; commonly used sizes are 2048 bits and 3072 bits.
            \item Smaller keys (e.g., 1024 bits) are increasingly vulnerable due to advances in computational power.
            \item Example: As of 2023, 1024-bit keys are susceptible to sophisticated factoring techniques like the General Number Field Sieve (GNFS).
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Timing Attacks:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item RSA is susceptible to side-channel attacks, including timing attacks where computation time variations are exploited to deduce information about the private key.
            \item Implementing constant-time algorithms mitigates such risks.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Padding Schemes:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Improper padding schemes (e.g., PKCS#1 v1.5) can lead to chosen ciphertext attacks.
            \item It is crucial to use secure padding mechanisms (e.g., OAEP) to ensure the security of underlying messages.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
