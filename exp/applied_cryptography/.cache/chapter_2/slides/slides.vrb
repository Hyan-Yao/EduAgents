            \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
                \hline
                \textbf{Symmetric Cryptography} & \textbf{Asymmetric Cryptography} \\ \hline
                Single Key for encryption/decryption & Two Keys: Public \& Private \\ \hline
                Fast processing speeds & Slower due to complex algorithms \\ \hline
                Key management is challenging & Easier key distribution \\ \hline
                Less secure against key compromise & More secure in many scenarios \\ \hline
