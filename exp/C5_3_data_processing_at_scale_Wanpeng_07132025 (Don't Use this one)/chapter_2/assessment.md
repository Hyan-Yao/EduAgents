## Section 16: Q&A Session

### Learning Objectives
- Clarify any unresolved questions regarding distributed databases.
- Encourage collaborative learning through discussion of distributed database concepts.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What does the CAP theorem state regarding distributed databases?

  A) A distributed database can guarantee any two of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
  B) A distributed database can guarantee all three properties at once.
  C) A distributed database can guarantee only Consistency and Availability under all circumstances.
  D) A distributed database should not be concerned with Consistency or Partition Tolerance.

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** The CAP theorem states that in a distributed database, you can only achieve two of the three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance at the same time.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is a benefit of data replication in distributed databases?

  A) Data locality.
  B) Enhanced fault tolerance.
  C) Increased data redundancy.
  D) Improved disk space efficiency.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Data replication enhances fault tolerance by ensuring that copies of data are available even if some nodes fail, thus improving the system's robustness.

**Question 3:** In a client-server model of distributed databases, who initiates the queries?

  A) Only the server.
  B) Only the client.
  C) Any node in the network.
  D) Both client and server equally.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** In a client-server model, the client initiates queries by sending requests to the server, which processes them and returns the results.

**Question 4:** What is the primary advantage of sharding in distributed databases?

  A) It ensures data redundancy.
  B) It makes data locality less relevant.
  C) It allows a single database to handle larger datasets by partitioning them.
  D) It guarantees consistency across nodes.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Sharding allows a single database to manage larger datasets by partitioning the data into smaller, more manageable pieces, or shards, that can be distributed across multiple nodes.

### Activities
- Group activity: Form groups and discuss potential applications of distributed databases in modern scenarios, focusing on scalability challenges.
- Create a use case: Individually, create a detailed use case for implementing a distributed database in a specific industry of your choice.

### Discussion Questions
- What are the practical implications of choosing a distributed database over a traditional database?
- How does data consistency impact application performance in distributed environments?
- Can you provide real-world scenarios where sharding and replication were effectively implemented?
