    \begin{block}{Introduction}
        Cloud computing provides a variety of services through the internet. Understanding the different service models helps businesses determine the best fit for their needs. The three primary cloud service models are:
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
        \item Platform as a Service (PaaS)
        \item Software as a Service (SaaS)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)}
    
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        A model where cloud providers offer virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS provides essential infrastructure services, such as storage, networking, and servers.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        AWS EC2 (Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud) allows users to rent virtual servers and manage compute resources without needing physical hardware.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Benefits}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
            \item Flexibility: Users can customize and configure their infrastructure.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{2. Platform as a Service (PaaS) \& 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)}
    
    \begin{block}{PaaS: Definition}
        Allows developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, operating systems, or server configurations.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{PaaS: Example}
        Google App Engine enables developers to build applications and services while Google handles the backend infrastructure.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{PaaS: Key Benefits}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Simplifies the development process: Provides built-in software tools and development frameworks.
            \item Accelerates development: Faster time to market as developers don't manage hardware and software layers.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{SaaS: Definition}
        Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access software through a web browser, eliminating the need for installations.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{SaaS: Example}
        Microsoft 365 offers various applications like Word, Excel, and Outlook online, accessible from any device with internet connectivity.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{SaaS: Key Benefits}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Accessibility: Users can access applications from anywhere, facilitating remote work.
            \item Maintenance-free: Automatic updates and backups are managed by the provider.
