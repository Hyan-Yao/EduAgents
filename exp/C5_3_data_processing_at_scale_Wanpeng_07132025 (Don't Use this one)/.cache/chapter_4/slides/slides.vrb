\frametitle{Summary and Key Takeaways - Importance of Hadoop and MapReduce}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Scalability}: Handles vast amounts of data by adding more nodes.
        \item \textbf{Fault-tolerance}: HDFS replicates data, ensuring availability during hardware failure.
        \item \textbf{Cost-effective}: Utilizes commodity hardware, reducing investment compared to traditional data warehouses.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Remember}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Hadoop encompasses tools like HDFS, YARN, and others (e.g., Hive, Pig).
            \item MapReduce simplifies parallel processing for large datasets.
        \end{itemize}
