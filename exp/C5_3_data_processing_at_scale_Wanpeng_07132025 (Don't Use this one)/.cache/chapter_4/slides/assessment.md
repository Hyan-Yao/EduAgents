**Explanation:** During the 'Map' phase, data is transformed into intermediate key-value pairs for further processing.

**Question 3:** Which feature of Hadoop ensures data reliability?

  A) Replication of data
  B) Simple interface
  C) Fast processing speed
  D) Real-time processing

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Hadoop ensures data reliability through the replication of data across multiple nodes in the cluster.

**Question 4:** What is the role of YARN in the Hadoop ecosystem?

  A) Storing data
  B) Scheduling and resource allocation
  C) Creating MapReduce jobs
  D) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is responsible for job scheduling and resource allocation within the Hadoop ecosystem.
