# Final Project Plan Document

## Project Title: **Design and Deployment of a Scalable Cloud Database Solution**

### Description
This project aims to provide students with hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and managing a scalable cloud database solution that simulates real-world challenges faced in distributed systems. 

### Learning Objectives
Students will:
1. Differentiate among various data models for business use cases.
2. Implement scalable query processing and analytics using frameworks like Hadoop and Spark.
3. Design and deploy a cloud-based database system optimizing for scalability, reliability, and performance.
4. Manage and document data pipelines in distributed architectures.
5. Collaborate effectively and communicate technical solutions.
