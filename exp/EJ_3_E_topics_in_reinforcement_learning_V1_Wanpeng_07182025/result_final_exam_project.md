# Final Project Plan: Reinforcement Learning Challenge

## Project Description
The "Reinforcement Learning Challenge" immerses students in the real-world applications of reinforcement learning by collaborating to design, implement, and present a complex reinforcement learning model. This aligns with course objectives, allowing students to demonstrate applied skills, critical thinking, and effective communication.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, students will:
1. Define and explain key reinforcement learning concepts and their applications.
2. Analyze and apply various reinforcement learning algorithms to real-world scenarios.
3. Evaluate performance metrics and articulate effectiveness based on empirical results.
4. Design and implement reinforcement learning models using industry-standard frameworks (Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch).
5. Engage in critical discussions about advancements in reinforcement learning.
6. Communicate findings effectively in both written and oral formats.
