    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Engagement}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Definition}: The process of capturing and maintaining the audience’s interest and participation.
                \item \textbf{Importance}: Engaged audiences are more likely to absorb and retain information.
                \item \textbf{Tips}:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Use questions to encourage interaction (e.g., “Have you ever faced this issue?”).
                        \item Integrate stories or personal anecdotes for relatability.
                        \item Use visual aids (charts, images, graphs) to reinforce key points.
                        \item \textbf{Example}: Instead of merely listing data, present it in a story format: “In 2021, our sales soared—thanks to a dedicated team and strategic planning.”
