    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP)}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Utilizes function approximation for value functions and policies, improving scalability in high-dimensional spaces.
                \item Key: Reduces computational burden and memory requirements.
                \item Example: Neural networks approximate the value function in complex state spaces.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Model-Free and Model-Based Approaches}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Hybrid models enhance efficiency by integrating strengths of both approaches.
                \item Key: Agents can plan actions using a learned model, reducing exploration in unknown environments.
                \item Example: AlphaZero combines deep learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Incorporation of Deep Learning}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables handling vast state spaces with neural networks.
                \item Key: Enables application of DP techniques in complex environments.
                \item Example: AlphaGo's evaluation function improves DP-based algorithms.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI)}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Expanded GPI framework facilitates better policy evaluation and improvement interactions.
                \item Key: Enhances robustness and adaptability to changing environments.
                \item Example: Modern adaptations like SARSA(Î») improve convergence and efficiency.
