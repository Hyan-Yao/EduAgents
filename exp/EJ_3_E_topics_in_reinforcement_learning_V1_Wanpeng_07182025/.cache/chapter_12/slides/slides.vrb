\frametitle{Learning Outcomes Recap - Model Development}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Capability to design, implement, and refine RL models for specific applications.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Importance of feature selection, model architecture (e.g., neural networks in DQNs), and hyperparameter tuning.
        \item Tackling challenges such as overfitting, sample efficiency, and exploration vs. exploitation.
    \end{itemize}
