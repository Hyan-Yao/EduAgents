\frametitle{Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning - Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reinforcement Learning (RL) revolves around the interaction between the agent and its environment.
        \item The agentâ€™s goal is to learn a strategy (policy) that maximizes its cumulative rewards over time.
        \item The cycle of choosing actions, receiving rewards, and updating knowledge is fundamental to the learning process in RL.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Summary}
        In reinforcement learning, the agent learns to make optimal decisions through exploration and exploitation within an environment. By understanding actions and rewards, agents adjust their strategies to achieve better performance over time.
