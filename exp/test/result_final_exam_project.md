Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan: Data Mining in Action

## Project Description
The final project aims to replace the traditional final exam in the Data Mining course (DM101) by providing an opportunity for students to apply data mining techniques to address a specific real-world problem through collaboration in teams. This structure encourages practical application of knowledge gained throughout the course and enhances students' analytical thinking and communication skills.

## Project Objectives
- Apply data mining techniques (both supervised and unsupervised learning) to real-world datasets.
- Develop data preparation skills through cleaning and transforming datasets.
- Evaluate model performance and accuracy with a focus on analytical rigor.
- Discuss ethical considerations in data mining as they relate to the chosen problem.
- Communicate findings effectively through both a written report and presentations.

## Timeline with Milestones
| Milestone                     | Description                                              | Due Date      | Percentage of Final Grade |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Milestone 1: Team Formation & Proposal | Define the problem, data sources, methods, and expected outcomes. Present to peers for feedback. | Week 6       | 5%                       |
| Milestone 2: Progress Report  | Update on data cleaning, analysis techniques, and preliminary results. | Week 12      | 5%                       |
| Milestone 3: Final Presentation | Present problem, methodology, findings, and implications.  | Week 14      | 10%                      |
| Milestone 4: Final Report     | Comprehensive documentation of methodology, results, ethical implications, and future recommendations. | One week after presentations | 10%                      |
