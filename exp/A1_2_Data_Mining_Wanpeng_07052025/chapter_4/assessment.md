**Question 1:** What is the main purpose of logistic regression?

  A) To sort data into clusters
  B) To perform regression analysis
  C) To predict binary outcomes
  D) To analyze time series data

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Logistic regression is designed specifically for binary classification problems where the output variable can take two possible outcomes.

**Question 2:** Which metric is NOT commonly used to evaluate a logistic regression model?

  A) Accuracy
  B) Mean Squared Error
  C) F1 Score
  D) ROC Curve

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) is typically used for regression problems, while metrics like accuracy, F1 Score, and ROC Curve are used for classification models, including logistic regression.

**Question 3:** Which of the following is an assumption of logistic regression?

  A) The target variable must be normally distributed
  B) The log-odds of the outcome are a linear combination of the independent variables
  C) There must be a constant variance in the dependent variable
  D) All predictors must be categorical

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** One of the critical assumptions of logistic regression is that the log-odds of the dependent variable is a linear combination of the independent variables.

**Question 4:** In logistic regression, what does the ROC curve represent?

  A) Relationship between precision and recall
  B) Relationship between the true positive rate and false positive rate
  C) The overall accuracy of the model
  D) The distribution of independent variables

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve illustrates the relationship between true positive rates and false positive rates at various threshold settings.
