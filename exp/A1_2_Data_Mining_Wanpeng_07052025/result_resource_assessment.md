# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Delivering the **A1_Data_Mining** Course

## Introduction
The delivery of the **A1_Data_Mining** course requires careful consideration of various factors, including faculty expertise, computing resources, software needs, scheduling considerations, and facility limitations. This assessment outlines the necessary elements for ensuring effective course delivery.

## Faculty Expertise Requirements
### Depth in Subject Matter
- Faculty must have a robust understanding of:
  - Data mining techniques including supervised and unsupervised learning.
  - Data preparation and cleaning techniques.
  - Advanced topics such as text mining and reinforcement learning.
  - Performance metrics and model evaluation techniques.
  - Ethical standards in data handling, compliant with the ASU Academic Integrity Policy.

### Pedagogical Skills
- Experience in delivering complex technical content.
- Ability to engage students through interactive sessions.
- Proficiency in guiding practical implementations.

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration
- Capability to foster collaboration among students from diverse disciplines, particularly for capstone projects.

## Computing Resources Needed
### Hardware Needs
- Classroom should be constructed with computers or provide reliable Wi-Fi access for remote logins.
  
### Software Access
- Access to programming environments such as Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks.
- Essential libraries for data analysis (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib) must be pre-installed.

### Learning Management System (LMS)
- Management of course materials, assignments, and grading to be conducted within Canvas (ASU standard).
- Assignments should be collected in standard formats, including PDF and .ipynb files.

## Software Requirements
### Programming Environments
- Use of Python is essential, with specific versions of libraries being maintained for compatibility.

### Compliance Considerations
- Faculty must be knowledgeable about tools ensuring compliance with ASU’s academic integrity and copyright standards.

### Accessibility Resources
- Compliance with ASU’s accessibility standards; availability of captioning services and accessible document formats is necessary.

## Scheduling Constraints
### Class Structure
- Fixed class schedule: Tuesday, 10:30 AM – 11:45 AM; requires strategic pacing of content delivery and the integration of interactive elements.

### TA Support Availability
- Limited to one TA; availability constrained to Monday and Friday from 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM, which may necessitate additional TA support during peak times.

## Facility Limitations
### Classroom Environment
- The classroom must be equipped with presentation tools (e.g., projector) and suitable seating arrangements for both lectures and group collaboration.

### Interactive Learning Space
- Designing a classroom capable of accommodating both traditional teaching and hands-on exercises.

## Proposed Solutions
- **Faculty Development**: Implement workshops on effective teaching strategies for technical subjects.
- **Resource Assessment**: Conduct an inventory check of available hardware and software, assessing additional needs and requesting more TA support as necessary.
- **LMS Training**: Organize training sessions focused on Canvas usage, emphasizing accessibility features.
- **Improve Accessibility**: Collaborate with disability services to ensure compliance with accessibility standards, providing necessary resources.
- **Flexible Scheduling Options**: Explore supplementary TA sessions or online resources to meet student needs effectively.

## Conclusion
To effectively deliver the **A1_Data_Mining** course, attention to faculty expertise, computing and software resources, scheduling constraints, and facility suitability is essential. By addressing these elements, the course can achieve its educational objectives while complying with institutional standards.
