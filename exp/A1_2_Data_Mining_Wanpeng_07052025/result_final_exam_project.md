# Final Project Plan: "Data Insights for Social Change"

## Project Description
The final project for the A1_Data_Mining course is designed to assess students' understanding and application of data mining techniques. Emphasizing real-world relevance, students will work in teams to analyze a dataset with the goal of deriving insights that can contribute to social change.

## Objectives
1. **Data Preparation and Exploration**: Mastery in data exploration and preparation techniques.
2. **Supervised Learning Techniques**: Implement supervised learning algorithms effectively.
3. **Unsupervised Learning Methods**: Apply clustering and dimensionality reduction for pattern recognition.
4. **Advanced Topics**: Explore advanced data mining methodologies like text mining or reinforcement learning.
5. **Team Collaboration**: Foster effective teamwork and synthesizing diverse perspectives.
6. **Ethics in Data**: Address ethical considerations in data usage, adhering to ASU's Academic Integrity Policy.

## Timeline with Milestones
- **Week 11**: Team Formation
  - Formation of teams (3-5 members); submission of member list with defined roles.
  
- **Week 12**: Proposal Submission
  - Submit a 1-2 page proposal in .pdf format detailing objectives, dataset, and methodologies.
  - **Weight**: 5% of final grade.
  
- **Week 14**: Progress Report
  - Mid-project presentation (5 minutes) and a .pdf report on challenges and next steps.
  - **Weight**: 10% of final grade.
  
- **Week 15**: Final Presentation
  - Present findings in a 10-minute presentation covering methodologies and insights.
  - **Weight**: 10% of final grade.
  
- **Week 16**: Final Written Report
  - Comprehensive report in .pdf format including introduction, methodology, results, discussion, conclusions.
  - **Weight**: 5% of final grade.

## Deliverables
