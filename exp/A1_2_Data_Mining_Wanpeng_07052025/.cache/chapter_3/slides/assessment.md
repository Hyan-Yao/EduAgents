**Explanation:** Min-Max Scaling is a common normalization technique that transforms data into a bounded range, typically [0, 1].

**Question 3:** Data exploration often helps to identify which of the following?

  A) Database security measures
  B) Complex data structures
  C) Patterns and anomalies in data
  D) Data storage solutions

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The process of data exploration is intended to identify patterns, anomalies, and test hypotheses about the data.

### Activities
- Prepare at least two questions related to data exploration or normalization to discuss during the session.
- Select a data visualization tool and create a visualization based on a given data set; be ready to present it.

### Discussion Questions
- What are some common pitfalls in data visualization that can lead to misinterpretation?
- How would you approach exploring a new data set that you are unfamiliar with?
- In what scenarios have you found data normalization to be particularly beneficial, and why?
