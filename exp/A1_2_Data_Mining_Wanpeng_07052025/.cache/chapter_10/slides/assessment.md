**Explanation:** Dimensionality reduction is especially useful when dealing with high-dimensional data, as it helps to simplify analysis and visualization.

**Question 4:** What does PCA primarily aim to achieve?

  A) To randomly select features from the dataset.
  B) To project data into lower dimensions while preserving variance.
  C) To increase the number of features for better accuracy.
  D) To reduce the data size without consideration of variance.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** PCA projects data into lower dimensions while aiming to preserve as much of the variance (information) as possible.

### Activities
- Conduct a hands-on session where you apply PCA on a real dataset using Python and visualize the results. Write a short summary of your observations and findings.

### Discussion Questions
- What are the ethical implications of using dimensionality reduction techniques in data analysis?
- How would you explain the importance of dimensionality reduction to someone unfamiliar with data mining?
- In your opinion, what are the limitations of dimensionality reduction techniques, and how can they impact model performance?
