\frametitle{What is Reinforcement Learning? - Part 4}
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        The goal of RL can be mathematically represented as maximizing the expected cumulative rewards \( R \):
        \begin{equation}
            R = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t r_t
        \end{equation}
        where \( r_t \) is the reward at time \( t \) and \( \gamma \) (0 â‰¤ \( \gamma \) < 1) is the discount factor that balances immediate and future rewards.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Reinforcement Learning is a powerful framework that empowers agents to learn from their interactions, making it a fundamental pillar in the field of artificial intelligence.
