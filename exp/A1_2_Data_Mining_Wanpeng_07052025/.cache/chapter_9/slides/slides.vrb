    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The K-means algorithm is iterative and involves repeated reassignment and updating of centroids.
            \item Effective for clustering large datasets, but requires careful consideration of k and sensitivity to outliers.
            \item Visualizing clusters can reveal patterns within the data.
        \end{itemize}
