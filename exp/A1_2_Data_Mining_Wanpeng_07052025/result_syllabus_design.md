### Course Overview
The A1_Data_Mining course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of data mining techniques. Over the span of 16 weeks, students will master data preparation, supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, advanced topics in data mining, and culminate their learning in a capstone project.

---

### Course Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Apply core data mining techniques (classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection) to real-world datasets.
2. Evaluate model performance using standard metrics and justify model selection based on problem context.
3. Demonstrate proficiency in data preparation and exploratory data analysis.
4. Understand ethical considerations in data mining and data handling.
