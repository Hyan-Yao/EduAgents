  A) Principal Component Analysis
  B) Bagging and Bootstrap Sampling
  C) Feature Scaling
  D) Neural Networks

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Random Forests utilize bagging and bootstrap sampling to create diverse trees, which helps in reducing overfitting.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is a disadvantage of Random Forests?

  A) They are easy to interpret.
  B) They are computationally intensive.
  C) They have poor handling of missing values.
  D) They can only be used for classification tasks.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Random Forests can be resource-demanding particularly when a large number of trees are needed for training.

**Question 3:** In which scenario would Random Forests be particularly advantageous?

  A) When the dataset is small and clean.
  B) When interpretability of the model is a top priority.
  C) When handling datasets with missing values.
  D) When the model needs to be quick and lightweight.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Random Forests maintain accuracy well even with missing values, making them more suitable for datasets where data integrity is an issue.

**Question 4:** What role does feature randomness play in Random Forests?

  A) It ensures all features are used in every split.
  B) It enhances the learning speed of trees.
  C) It promotes diversity among trees to prevent overfitting.
  D) It improves data normalization.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** By only considering a random subset of features at each split, Random Forests encourage diversity in the trees, which aids in preventing overfitting.
