**Explanation:** Overfitting is a common challenge when using complex ensemble methods, as they may become too tailored to training data.

### Activities
- Participate in a hands-on coding session where students will implement an ensemble method of their choice using Python and scikit-learn. Datasets can be drawn from sources like Kaggle.
- Group project: Analyze a real-world dataset where students will compare the performance of ensemble methods against individual learning models.

### Discussion Questions
- What real-world problems do you think can be effectively solved using ensemble learning methods?
- How can overfitting in ensemble models be identified and addressed during model training?
