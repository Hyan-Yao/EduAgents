**2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments**

1. **Module on Data Mining Techniques**: 
   - Introduce a foundational module covering core data mining topics such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection early in the course to address gaps.

2. **Familiarization with Tools**:
   - Create initial hands-on workshops focused on Google Colab and Scikit-learn to ensure all students have the necessary skills to utilize these tools effectively.

3. **Mathematical Review Session**:
   - Incorporate a review module on linear algebra and probability before diving into complex data mining algorithms to solidify students’ understanding.

4. **Simplified Language Resources**:
   - Offer materials with simplified language and clear definitions of complex terms to assist non-native speakers in fully grasping content.

5. **Project-Based Assessments**:
   - Shift assessment strategy towards frequent, project-based assignments that reflect real-world applications, moving away from high-stakes testing for better engagement and practical learning.

6. **Incremental Learning Approach**:
   - Structure the course content incrementally, starting with basic concepts and gradually increasing in complexity, thereby supporting confidence building among students.

7. **Collaborative Learning Opportunities**:
   - Design group projects that encourage collaboration, leveraging the diverse skill sets of students and allowing peer learning.

8. **Supplementary Resource Provision**:
   - Develop an online repository of supplementary materials (tutorials, guides) that students can access based on their individual learning needs.

9. **Ethical Framework Introduction**:
   - Incorporate ethical discussions throughout the course structure to align with the increasing importance of responsible data handling in students' future careers.

10. **Cultural Representation**:
   - Include the Chinese name 姚怀远 in all course materials to support cultural representation and foster inclusivity among the student body.
