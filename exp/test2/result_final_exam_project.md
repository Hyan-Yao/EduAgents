# Final Project Plan Document

## Project Title: **Real-World Data Mining Challenge**

---

### Project Description
The final project for DM101 aims to apply data mining techniques and ethical practices learned throughout the course within a real-world context. Students will explore, analyze, and present findings from real datasets, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills relevant to the data mining field.

### Objectives
By the end of this project, students will:
1. Comprehend and define key data mining concepts.
2. Execute data exploration and preprocessing techniques effectively.
3. Apply supervised and unsupervised learning methods to solve practical questions.
4. Analyze and evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
5. Collaborate effectively within teams, simulating real-world data mining challenges.
6. Implement ethical practices in data mining.
