Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

1. **Conceptual Understanding**: Students will demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the data mining lifecycle and core concepts, including classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

2. **Technical Proficiency**: Students will apply various data mining techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks, and ensemble methods to real-world datasets, while understanding the appropriate contexts for each technique's application.

3. **Data Preparation Skills**: Students will master data preparation processes including data exploration, visualization, normalization, feature extraction, and data cleaning to ensure datasets are suitable for analysis.

4. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**: Students will evaluate model performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, and will interpret these metrics in the context of decision-making.

5. **Advanced Techniques**: Students will explore advanced data mining topics, including text mining, representation learning, and fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning, while assessing their applicability to diverse datasets.

6. **Practical Application**: Students will complete a final project that integrates the techniques learned in class, showcasing their ability to solve complex data mining problems through collaborative efforts.

7. **Ethical Considerations**: Students will develop an understanding of the ethical implications of data mining, addressing issues related to privacy, security, data integrity, and relevant regulations such as GDPR.
