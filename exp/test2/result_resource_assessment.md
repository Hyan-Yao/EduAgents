Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource & Constraints Assessment for "Data Mining" Course Delivery

## 1. Faculty Expertise Requirements
### Prerequisites
- Expertise in data mining techniques and statistical analysis.
- Proficiency in programming (preferably in Python).
- Familiarity with machine learning frameworks and ethical considerations.

### Qualifications
- A postgraduate degree in Data Science, Computer Science, or a related field.
- Experience in data mining, machine learning, and adherence to ethical standards in data usage.

### Teaching Methodology
- Familiarity with interactive teaching methods (live demos, hands-on labs).
- Incorporation of guest speakers/co-instructors for specialized topics to provide diverse perspectives.

## 2. Necessary Computing Resources
### Hardware
- Student laptops capable of running data mining software.
- Classroom equipped with a projector and reliable internet access for live demonstrations.
- Backup systems for students experiencing technical difficulties, such as access to university IT services or virtual machines.

### Software Requirements
- Access to a coding environment compatible with Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., Google Colab).
- Required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## 3. Software and Platform Requirements
### Learning Management System (LMS)
- Utilization of Canvas for managing instructional materials, submissions, and grading.
- Compliance with ASU’s academic policies regarding accessibility and standards.

### Submission Formats
- Student submissions in .pdf and .ipynb formats to facilitate easy evaluation.

### Software Support
- Detailed software installation instructions and troubleshooting guidelines included in the syllabus.
- Links to documentation for libraries and tools used in class provided to familiarize students.

## 4. TA Support Availability
- One Teaching Assistant (TA) available for grading and feedback.
- Weekly office hours (Monday & Friday 3:00-4:00 PM via Zoom) and appointment-based support.
- Clear communication regarding the TA’s role in relation to course content to manage student expectations.
- Consideration of a peer mentoring system for informal academic support from advanced students.

## 5. Scheduling and Facility Limitations
### Course Schedule
- Classes scheduled for Tuesdays from 10:30 AM to 11:45 AM.

### Classroom Requirements
- Classroom should facilitate lecture format and interactive computation/collaborative work.
- Evaluate the need for additional lab time or online alternatives to accommodate scheduling conflicts.
- Ensure classroom layout supports group work and real-time interaction during labs, preferably with movable furniture.

## 6. Key Considerations
### Ethical Implications
- Integration of ethical considerations throughout the curriculum, not as isolated topics.
- Use of case studies and real-world data mining challenges to highlight ethical dilemmas.

### Final Project
- Development of a comprehensive grading rubric to evaluate the final project clearly and consistently.

## Suggested Syllabus Outline
- Each week will have defined learning objectives aligning with overall course goals.
- Incorporation of active learning techniques: group discussions, live coding sessions.

## Additional Remarks
- Inclusion of the Chinese name 姚怀远 on all course materials to ensure cultural representation and identity affirmation.
- Provision of supplementary materials (videos, podcasts, reading lists) to cater to diverse learning styles. 

## Conclusion
The course on "Data Mining" is feasible with the requirements laid out, ensuring that adequate faculty expertise, computing resources, and ethical considerations are in place. Collaboration among involved parties is essential to create an engaging and effective learning environment.
