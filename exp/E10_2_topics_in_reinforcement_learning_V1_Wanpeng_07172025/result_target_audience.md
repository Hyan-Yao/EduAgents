**2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments**

1. **Pre-Course Survey**: Implement a survey to gauge specific knowledge gaps and familiarity with tools among students.

2. **Supplemental Workshops**: Offer workshops on simulation tools and advanced concepts (e.g., Python libraries, TensorFlow, OpenAI Gym) before course commencement.

3. **Structured Project Work**: Create regular, smaller projects leading up to larger assessments to sustain engagement and appraise practical application aligned with real-world relevance.

4. **Scaffolding Lessons**: Introduce complex topics gradually, utilizing various instructional formats (lectures, hands-on activities, discussions) to ensure comprehension.

5. **Clear Communication**: Provide accessible resources for mathematical concepts and research methodologies, including video tutorials and Q&A sessions, to facilitate understanding.

6. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Use mid-course surveys to adapt teaching strategies in response to student needs, promoting an adaptable learning environment.

7. **Ethics in AI Module**: Integrate discussions or case studies focusing on the ethical implications of reinforcement learning applications to foster student awareness of responsibility in technology.

By implementing these recommendations, the course can better align with student backgrounds and aspirations, enhancing their overall learning experience while addressing identified knowledge gaps.
