# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: E10_2_topics_in_reinforcement_learning

## 1. Faculty Expertise Requirements
- **Instructor Background**: 
  - Advanced knowledge in reinforcement learning, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and applied mathematics.
  - Familiarity with control systems and optimization techniques is essential.
- **Research Competence**: 
  - Capability to guide student research projects and provide feedback on methodologies.
  - Cultivation of critical thinking in analyzing reinforcement learning methods is necessary.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge**: 
  - Strong insights into neural networks and multi-agent systems for interdisciplinary student projects.

## 2. Necessary Computing Resources
- **Computing Power**: 
  - Access to high-performance computers with GPU capabilities for running computationally intensive reinforcement learning algorithms.
  - Consideration for backup resources such as cloud computing solutions (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS) for scalability.
  
- **Software Requirements**:
  - **Programming Languages**: Proficiency in Python is essential for the implementation of algorithms.
  - **Reinforcement Learning Libraries**: Libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenAI Gym must be available for practical exercises.
  - **Mathematical Modeling Tools**: Access to MATLAB or R for theoretical simulations may be beneficial.
  - **Simulation Frameworks**: Installation and accessibility of simulation software prior to the course start.

## 3. Scheduling Constraints
- **Class Duration and Format**: 
  - 2.5-hour class sessions require careful structuring to maintain student engagement (mix of lectures, hands-on activities, discussions).
- **TA Support**: 
  - One TA available, scheduling must synchronize with class and office hours to provide effective student support.

## 4. Facility Limitations
- **Classroom Setup**: 
  - Classrooms should include projectors, whiteboards, and adequate computers for all students.
  - Stable internet connectivity is imperative for accessing online resources.
  - Availability of breakout spaces for collaborative group discussions and projects.

## 5. Policy and Compliance Considerations
- **Academic Integrity**: 
  - Adherence to Duke University’s academic integrity policy must be mandated, including clarity on submissions and collaborative work.
- **Accessibility Standards**: 
  - Course materials and methods must comply with disability accommodation policies to ensure equitable access for all.
- **LMS Compliance**: 
  - Faculty and TA must be proficient in Sakai for managing course materials and submissions effectively.

## 6. Course Structure Requirements
- **Outlined Learning Outcomes**: 
  - Learning objectives must connect clearly with program learning outcomes, centering on reinforcement learning principles and applications.
- **Grading Policy**: 
  - Defined and transparent grading components to foster student understanding of assessment criteria.
- **Weekly Schedule**: 
  - A structured outline detailing weekly topics, assignments, and due dates to keep students aligned with learning goals.

## Conclusion
To effectively deliver the course “E10_2_topics_in_reinforcement_learning,” a thorough assessment of faculty expertise, computing resources, scheduling, facility limitations, policy compliance, and course structure is paramount.
