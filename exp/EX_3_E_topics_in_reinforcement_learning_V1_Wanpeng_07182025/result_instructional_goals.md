Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

1. **Knowledge Acquisition**:  
   - By the end of the course, students will be able to clearly define, articulate, and exemplify the fundamental principles of reinforcement learning and its components in both written and verbal formats.

2. **Algorithm Implementation**:  
   - Students will demonstrate the ability to implement and modify at least three different reinforcement learning algorithms in Python, evaluated through practical coding assessments.

3. **Application**:  
   - Students will effectively design and execute reinforcement learning experiments on a given problem, critically analyzing outcomes based on quantitative metrics, as assessed by project reports.

4. **Literature Review and Analysis**:  
   - Students will conduct a thorough literature review on a specific topic within reinforcement learning, present their findings, and formulate a research proposal highlighting existing gaps and next steps.

5. **Ethical Practice**:  
   - Upon completing the course, students will discuss and assess ethical considerations and societal impacts related to reinforcement learning technologies in class debates and written reflections.
