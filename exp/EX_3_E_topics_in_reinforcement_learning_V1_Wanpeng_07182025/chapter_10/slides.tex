    \begin{block}{Scenario}
        Consider a drone learning to navigate through obstacles. While the RL algorithm is developed in simulation, it needs validation in the real world to account for issues like wind resistance and sensor inaccuracies.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Key Points and Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Trade-offs:} The choice between simulation and real experimentation involves a balance between control and realism.

        \item \textbf{Data Collection:} Distinct types of data are yielded from each experiment type, aiding in improvements.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Experimentation is foundational in reinforcement learning. Selecting the right type of experiment significantly impacts RL project outcomes.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Data Collection Methods}
    \begin{block}{Overview of Data Collection in Reinforcement Learning}
        Data collection is a fundamental aspect of reinforcement learning (RL) experiments, enabling evaluation and improvement of agent performance. This presentation focuses on two core methods: exploration strategies and logging systems.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Exploration Strategies}
    Exploration strategies dictate how an RL agent gathers information about the environment, balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (leveraging known actions). Common strategies include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The agent selects the best-known action with a probability of \(1 - \epsilon\) and a random action with probability \(\epsilon\).
            \item \textit{Example}: If \(\epsilon = 0.1\), the agent explores new actions 10\% of the time.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Softmax Action Selection}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Actions are chosen probabilistically based on their estimated values.
            \item \textit{Formula}: 
            \begin{equation}
                P(a) = \frac{\exp(Q(a)/\tau)}{\sum_{b} \exp(Q(b)/\tau)} 
            \end{equation}
            where \(\tau\) controls the exploration.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Balances exploration and exploitation by considering confidence intervals for action values.
            \item \textit{Example}: A high-value but less-frequent action may be favored.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Logging}
    Logging systematically records outcomes of agents' actions, essential for performance analysis and strategy refinement. Key concepts include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA)}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Log tuples of experience: \((s, a, r, s', a')\).
            \item \textit{Example}: An agent in state \(s\) taking action \(a\) receives reward \(r\) and transitions to state \(s'\) with action \(a'\) logged as \((s, a, r, s', a')\).
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Replay Buffers}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Stored past experiences improve diversity in training and enhance sample efficiency, mainly used in off-policy methods.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Balancing exploration and exploitation is critical.
            \item The choice of strategy influences learning and agent performance.
            \item Logging provides insights into agent decision-making.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Evaluation Metrics in Reinforcement Learning}
    % Introduction to the evaluation metrics in reinforcement learning.
    Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms require effective evaluation metrics to assess their performance. Let's explore the key metrics:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cumulative Reward
        \item Time to Convergence
        \item Robustness
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Cumulative Reward}
    % Definition and formula of Cumulative Reward
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Cumulative reward is the total reward accumulated over an episode or a series of episodes, serving as a direct performance measure.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{equation}
        Cumulative\ Reward = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + \ldots + r_n
    \end{equation}
    Where \(r_i\) represents the reward at time step \(i\).

    \begin{exampleblock}{Example}
        If an agent receives rewards of 1, 2, and 3 over three time steps, the cumulative reward is:
        \[
        1 + 2 + 3 = 6
        \]
    \end{exampleblock}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Higher cumulative rewards indicate better performance.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Time to Convergence and Robustness}
    % Discussion on Time to Convergence and Robustness
    \begin{block}{Time to Convergence}
        Refers to the number of episodes or iterations for an RL algorithm to reach stability.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Shorter time indicates a more efficient learning algorithm.
        \item Convergence is observed when performance metrics stabilize over episodes.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{exampleblock}{Example}
        If the RL agent improves in the first 50 episodes and then stabilizes, the time to convergence is approximately 50 episodes.
    \end{exampleblock}

    \begin{block}{Robustness}
        Evaluates performance under varying conditions such as changes in environment or parameters.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Generalization**: Agent's performance in unseen states.
        \item **Sensitivity Analysis**: Testing performance against various environmental changes.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Robust algorithms adapt well to real-world scenarios.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Summary and Conclusion}
    % Summary of key evaluation metrics
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Cumulative Reward** quantifies overall performance across episodes.
        \item **Time to Convergence** indicates learning efficiency.
        \item **Robustness** ensures adaptability and reliability.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Understanding these metrics is crucial for comparing reinforcement learning approaches. Focusing on these aspects allows for improved analysis and application of RL algorithms.
