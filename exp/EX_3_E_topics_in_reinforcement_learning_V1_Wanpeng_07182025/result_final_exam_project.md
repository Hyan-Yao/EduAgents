# Final Project Plan: Designing a Reinforcement Learning Solution for Real-World Applications

## Project Description
Students will design and implement a practical reinforcement learning solution addressing a real-world problem, encompassing research, algorithm implementation, and thorough analysis of results.

## Learning Objectives
1. Apply fundamental principles of reinforcement learning to a practical situation.
2. Implement and modify different reinforcement learning algorithms in Python.
3. Design, execute, and critically analyze experimental results based on quantitative metrics.
4. Conduct a thorough literature review and present coherent findings and proposals.
5. Engage in discussions of ethics and societal impacts related to their projects.

## Team Structure
- Groups of 3-4 students.
- Individual reflective component required for personal accountability.
