\frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{block}{Summary}
    Experimentation in reinforcement learning is a dynamic and evolving space, critical to the development of intelligent systems. An emphasis on ethical practice and innovative methodologies will shape the future of RL research and application across various domains.

  \begin{block}{Illustrative Example}
    Consider a robotic arm trained via RL to grasp objects. The agent experiments through trial and error:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Exploration}: Trying different angles and speeds for grasping.
      \item \textbf{Exploitation}: Leveraging previously successful strategies.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{equation}
      R(a) = \sum_{s'} P(s' | s, a) \cdot R(s')
    \end{equation}
    Where \( P(s' | s, a) \) represents the transition probability to the new state \( s' \) after taking action \( a \) from current state \( s \).
