    \frametitle{Understanding Reinforcement Learning - Part 1}
    \begin{block}{What is Reinforcement Learning?}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing certain actions in an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to maximize cumulative reward over time.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Components of RL}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Agent}: The learner or decision maker (e.g., a robot or software program).
            \item \textbf{Environment}: Everything the agent interacts with (e.g., the game world).
            \item \textbf{Actions}: Possible moves or decisions the agent can take (discrete or continuous).
            \item \textbf{Rewards}: Feedback received after taking an action (positive or negative).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Reinforcement Learning - Part 2}
    \begin{block}{The Learning Process}
        RL follows a trial-and-error approach where the agent explores actions to learn which yield the highest rewards. This process is mathematically represented by the Bellman Equation:
        \begin{equation}
            V(s) = \max_a \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) \left[ R(s,a,s') + \gamma V(s') \right]
        \end{equation}
        where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $V(s)$: Value function predicting expected cumulative reward from state $s$.
            \item $P(s'|s,a)$: Probability of reaching state $s'$ from state $s$ by taking action $a$.
            \item $R(s,a,s')$: Immediate reward after taking action $a$.
            \item $\gamma$: Discount factor for future rewards.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Reinforcement Learning - Part 3}
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The balance between exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing known rewarding actions) is critical.
            \item Rewards and penalties guide the agent's learning, influencing its behavior in the environment.
            \item Applications of RL span various domains including robotics, game AI, and autonomous systems.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Illustration Example}
        Imagine a robot (agent) navigating a maze (environment). The robot can move, turn, or stop (actions). Each time it finds the exit, it gains a positive reward (+10 points); hitting a wall results in a negative reward (-1 point). Through repetition, the robot learns the optimal path to maximize points.

  \frametitle{Ethical Considerations - Overview}
  
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to revolutionize various sectors by optimizing complex decision-making processes. 
  However, its deployment raises critical ethical issues that must be addressed to ensure systems operate fairly and responsibly.
  
  Two prominent ethical considerations in RL are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fairness
    \item Accountability
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Ethical Considerations - Fairness}
  
  \textbf{1. Fairness}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Definition}: Fairness in RL refers to the principle that outcomes should not discriminate against or favor certain groups over others.
    
    \item \textbf{Potential Issues}: RL algorithms learn by interacting with data from real-world environments, potentially leading to biased outcomes.
    
    \item \textbf{Example}: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item In job recruitment, an RL model trained on historical data might favor candidates from certain demographics, perpetuating inequality.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Key Point}: Fairness should be a design criterion for RL systems, requiring monitoring and adjustments to ensure equitable outcomes.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Ethical Considerations - Accountability}

  \textbf{2. Accountability}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Definition}: Accountability refers to the obligation of developers and organizations to take responsibility for actions and decisions made by RL systems.
    
    \item \textbf{Challenges}: RL systems often operate as "black boxes," making it tough to trace decision-making processes. 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If an RL agent makes a harmful decision, it is challenging to determine who is responsible: developers, data scientists, or organizations?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Example}: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item In autonomous vehicles, if an RL-controlled car is involved in an accident, establishing liability becomes complex.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Key Point}: Establishing clear accountability frameworks is essential for fostering trust in RL technologies, including transparency in decision-making.

  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Bias in Algorithms - Understanding Bias in Reinforcement Learning}
  
  \begin{block}{1. What is Bias?}
    Bias refers to systematic favoritism or prejudice that influences the decision-making process of algorithms. In the context of reinforcement learning (RL), bias can arise from:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Data used for training models
      \item Design of the algorithms
      \item Environments where agents operate
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Bias in Algorithms - Manifestations of Bias in RL Algorithms}

  \begin{block}{1. Training Data Bias}
      If the data used to train the RL model is skewed, the model may form biased policies. 
      \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Example:} A recommendation system trained on a specific demographic may miss diverse interests.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{2. Reward Structure Bias}
      The definition of rewards can introduce bias. If designed based on discriminatory historical data, the RL agent may replicate these biases.
      \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Example:} An RL algorithm for job applications might favor certain backgrounds due to historical hiring biases.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{block}{3. Exploration Bias}
      RL agents explore environments using defined strategies. Biased strategies lead to focused exploration, resulting in suboptimal outcomes.
      \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Example:} An RL robot may neglect some areas due to a strategy focused on high-reward zones.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Bias in Algorithms - Key Consequences of Bias in Decision-Making}
  
  \begin{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Loss of Trust:} Users may lose trust in technology when they perceive biased decisions.
      \item \textbf{Regulatory Challenges:} Non-compliance with emerging fairness regulations can lead to legal and financial repercussions.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Bias in Algorithms - Examples of Bias in RL Applications}
  
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Healthcare:} An RL model predicting treatment outcomes may favor certain demographics, resulting in unequal treatments.
      \item \textbf{Criminal Justice:} Predictive policing systems may inherit biases from historical arrest data, disproportionately affecting some communities.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Bias in Algorithms - Addressing Bias in RL}
  
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Diverse Training Data:} Ensuring varied datasets that include multiple demographics.
      \item \textbf{Fair Reward Design:} Crafting reward structures to promote fairness rather than just optimizing for short-term gains.
      \item \textbf{Regular Audits:} Continuous evaluation of RL systems to discover and fix biases.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}
