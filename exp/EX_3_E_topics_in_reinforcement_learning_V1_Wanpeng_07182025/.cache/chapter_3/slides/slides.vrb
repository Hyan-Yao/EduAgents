\frametitle{Summary and Conclusion - Implications and Takeaways}

  \begin{itemize}
      \item **Implications for RL**:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item DP is fundamental for advanced methods like Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference learning.
          \item Provides precise value estimates but requires a complete environment model.
          \item Understanding DP aids in handling larger state spaces through function approximation.
      \end{itemize}
      \item **Key Takeaways**:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Essential for optimal decision-making in RL.
          \item Utilizes the Bellman equation for evaluating and improving policies.
          \item Practical applications are limited by the need for comprehensive environment knowledge.
      \end{itemize}
