    \frametitle{Introduction to Student Project Presentations}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Welcome to the final project presentations! 
        This session explores various student projects utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. 
        It marks the culmination of your learning journey in this course.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Key Concepts of Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{What is Reinforcement Learning?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An area of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment.
            \item Agents receive feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, adjusting behavior to maximize cumulative rewards.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Core Elements of RL}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Agent}: The learner or decision-maker.
            \item \textbf{Environment}: Everything the agent interacts with.
            \item \textbf{Actions}: Choices made by the agent influencing the state.
            \item \textbf{States}: Representations of the environment at a given time.
            \item \textbf{Rewards}: Feedback signals evaluating actions taken.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example of Reinforcement Learning Application}
    \begin{block}{Chess Project}
        Consider a project training an RL agent to play chess:
        
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Agent}: The chess-playing program.
            \item \textbf{Environment}: The chessboard and all possible game scenarios.
            \item \textbf{Actions}: Moves made by the agent (e.g., moving a pawn).
            \item \textbf{States}: The current configuration of the chess pieces.
            \item \textbf{Rewards}: Points for capturing pieces/winning the game, penalties for losing pieces.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
    In your projects, emphasize the structure of your RL approach and the challenges faced.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Importance of Reinforcement Learning - Overview}
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. This approach contrasts with supervised learning, as RL relies on the consequences of actions rather than labeled data.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts of Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Agent:} The learner or decision-maker

        \item \textbf{Actions:} Choices made by the agent
        \item \textbf{States:} The situation of the agent at a particular time
        \item \textbf{Rewards:} Feedback received from the environment based on the actions taken
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example of Reinforcement Learning - Q-Learning}
    \begin{block}{Q-learning Formula}
        The Q-learning algorithm helps an agent learn the value of actions based on states. The formula is: 
        \[
        Q(s, a) \gets Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
        \]
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( Q(s, a) \): Value of action \( a \) in state \( s \)
        \item \( \alpha \): Learning rate (0 to 1)
        \item \( r \): Immediate reward after taking action \( a \)
        \item \( \gamma \): Discount factor (0 to 1) for future rewards
        \item \( s' \): New state post-action
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
