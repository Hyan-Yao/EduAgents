  A) They use deterministic algorithms.
  B) They rely on random sampling.
  C) They provide exact solutions to problems.
  D) They are only applicable in finance.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Monte Carlo methods are defined by their reliance on random sampling to estimate properties of a system, making them inherently probabilistic.

  A) They learn from individual actions.
  B) They focus on immediate rewards.
  C) They evaluate expected returns from complete episodes.
  D) They avoid exploration.

  B) Simulating particle interactions in physics.
  C) Solving linear equations.
  D) Risk assessment in engineering designs.

  B) On-policy methods update the same policy used in learning.
  C) Off-policy methods are always faster.
  D) On-policy methods do not collect data.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** On-policy methods evaluate and improve the same policy that is used to interact with the environment, while off-policy methods may use a different policy for evaluation.

**Question 2:** Which algorithm is an example of an off-policy method?

  A) SARSA
  B) Q-Learning
  C) REINFORCE
  D) Temporal Difference Learning

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Q-Learning is an off-policy method that learns the value of the optimal policy independently from the actions taken in the environment.

**Question 3:** In the context of Monte Carlo control, what is the main focus of the value function?

  A) To minimize the number of actions taken.
  B) To estimate the expected return from given states.
  C) To enforce fixed behaviors.
  D) To maximize the entropy of actions.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The value function estimates the expected return (or reward) that can be obtained from a particular state, which is critical for optimizing the agent's behavior.

### Activities
- Implement a simple reinforcement learning agent using SARSA and Q-Learning in Python. Compare their convergence and performance using a simple grid-world environment.

  A) Model-Free Learning
  B) High Variance
  C) Simplicity
  D) Strong Performance in Complex Environments

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** High variance is a limitation of Monte Carlo methods, while model-free learning, simplicity, and strong performance in complex environments are advantages.

  A) Continuous tasks with consistent rewards
  B) Non-episodic tasks with instantaneous feedback
  C) Episodic tasks with delayed or sparse rewards
  D) Tasks with deterministic outcomes

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Monte Carlo methods are particularly effective in episodic tasks where rewards are delayed, as they can learn from the entire sequence of actions leading to the final outcome.

**Question 3:** What is a potential challenge of using Monte Carlo methods in reinforcement learning?

  A) They require an explicit model of the environment.
  B) They may converge too quickly to a suboptimal policy.
  C) They cannot be used for games or episodic tasks.
  D) They are too complex to implement.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** One of the challenges of using Monte Carlo methods is that they rely on exploration which can lead to converging too quickly towards a suboptimal policy if the exploration is insufficient.

**Question 4:** Which approach is typically required for effective learning in environments with sparse rewards using Monte Carlo methods?

  A) Fewer episodes for faster convergence
  B) More exploration and systematic episode coverage
  C) Direct model learning
