\frametitle{Summary and Conclusion - Final Thoughts}
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Monte Carlo methods provide a robust framework for learning in reinforcement learning. They are essential for developing agents that adapt to complex environments and lay the groundwork for advanced methods such as Temporal-Difference learning.

    \begin{block}{Key Formula}
        The return at time \( t \) can be summarized as:
        \begin{equation}
            G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \ldots \\
        \end{equation}
        with \( 0 \leq \gamma < 1 \).
