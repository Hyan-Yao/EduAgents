\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Understand Scalable Machine Learning Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Scalability in Machine Learning:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The capacity of algorithms and systems to handle increasing amounts of data without sacrificing performance.
          \item \textit{Example:} A traditional logistic regression model may work well with a small dataset but can become slow or even infeasible with millions of records. Scalable ML techniques allow us to distribute data across multiple nodes to ensure efficient processing.
        \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Distributed Computing:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Involves using multiple computers (nodes) to share the workload of processing large datasets.
          \item \textbf{Key Technologies:}
            \begin{itemize}
              \item \textit{Apache Spark:} A powerful framework that makes distributed processing accessible and efficient.
              \item \textit{MLlib:} A scalable machine learning library built on top of Spark, designed for high-performance algorithms.
