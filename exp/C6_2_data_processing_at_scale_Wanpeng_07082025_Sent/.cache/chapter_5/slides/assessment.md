**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Spark SQL provides SQL syntax for querying structured data, which simplifies the process for users who are familiar with SQL, enhancing their ability to integrate analytics.

**Question 4:** What is one performance optimization technique discussed?

  A) Increasing the number of shuffle operations
  B) Caching RDDs for improved performance
  C) Using non-distributed computing environments
  D) Reducing the size of input data files

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Caching RDDs in Spark is an important technique for performance optimization, especially for iterative algorithms that access the same data multiple times.

### Activities
- Implement a simple Spark application that reads a CSV file into a DataFrame and performs a basic SQL query on it, similar to the example provided in this week's content.
- Reflect on the RDD and DataFrame concepts and create a comparison chart outlining their main differences and use cases.

### Discussion Questions
- In what scenarios would you choose to use RDDs over DataFrames?
- What challenges do you anticipate when performing graph processing with Spark?
