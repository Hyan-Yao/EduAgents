\begin{frame}[fragile]{Accessibility in Project Work - Introduction}
    \begin{block}{Introduction to Accessibility}
        Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. In the context of your capstone project, ensuring accessibility means making your deliverables usable for everyone, including individuals with varied disabilities (visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive).
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Accessibility in Project Work - Importance}
    \begin{block}{Importance of Accessibility Compliance}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Inclusivity}: Ensures full engagement from people with disabilities, which is both a moral and legal requirement.
            \item \textbf{User Experience}: Prioritizing accessibility leads to enhanced usability, resulting in higher satisfaction and a broader audience.
            \item \textbf{Market Reach}: An accessible project serves approximately 1 in 4 adults in the U.S. with disabilities, increasing feedback and improvements.
            \item \textbf{Compliance and Risk Management}: Meeting standards like WCAG 2.1 reduces legal risks and smooths acceptance processes.
        \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Accessibility in Project Work - Key Concepts}
    \begin{block}{Key Concepts to Ensure Accessibility}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Design for All}: Use universal design principles for all content formats (web, mobile, printed).
            \item \textbf{Text Alternatives}: Provide alt text for images to enable understanding by screen readers.
            \item \textbf{Keyboard Navigation}: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard for users without a mouse.
            \item \textbf{Color Contrast}: Maintain sufficient contrast between text and background for visually impaired users.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Accessibility in Project Work - Guidelines}
    \begin{block}{Accessibility Guidelines}
        Follow the WCAG principles:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Perceivable}: Ensure information can be perceived by all users.
            \item \textbf{Operable}: Interfaces must be easy to operate for all.
            \item \textbf{Understandable}: Content should be clear and comprehensible.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Accessibility in Project Work - Example and Key Points}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        A website with light gray text on a white background is visually unappealing for those with visual impairments. High-contrast designs improve legibility.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Prioritize accessibility from project inception.
            \item Conduct user testing with diverse groups for accessibility feedback.
            \item Stay updated with accessibility standards and educate your team.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
