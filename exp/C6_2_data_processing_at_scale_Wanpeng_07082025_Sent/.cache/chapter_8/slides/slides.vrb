\frametitle{Kafka Architecture - Key Components}
\begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Brokers}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Definition}: A Kafka broker is a server that stores messages. Each Kafka cluster is made up of one or more brokers.
            \item \textit{Functionality}: Brokers handle storage, retrieval of data, manage client requests, and ensure durability through replication.
            \item \textit{Example}: In a cluster with three brokers, data is distributed among them to ensure load balancing and reduce data loss.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Topics}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Definition}: A topic is a category or feed name to which records are published, acting as message queues.
            \item \textit{Partitioning}: Each topic can have multiple partitions to allow parallelism; each immutable sequence of messages is ordered.
            \item \textit{Example}: A topic named "sensor_data" may have multiple partitions based on sensor types (e.g., temperature, humidity).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
