Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: "C6_2 Data Processing at Scale"

## I. Faculty Expertise Requirements

### A. Technical Proficiency
1. **Subject Matter Expertise**
   - Strong background in big data systems, batch and stream processing.
   - Proficiency in frameworks such as MapReduce and Spark.
   - Practical experience in developing distributed applications and machine learning applications in big data environments.

2. **Pedagogical Skills**
   - Experience in facilitating hands-on labs and active learning environments.
   - Strong communication skills to convey complex concepts to diverse student audiences.

3. **Workload Considerations**
   - Realistic faculty workload focusing on preparation for labs, grading, and student support.

## II. Necessary Computing Resources

### A. Infrastructure Needs
1. **Technical Infrastructure**
   - Access to Hadoop and Spark environments for hands-on experience.
   - High-performance computing environments, potentially using cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for scalable data handling.

2. **Laboratory Setup**
   - Dedicated lab spaces with adequate computers equipped with necessary hardware and software.
   - A well-configured network to support real-time data transfers.

### B. Computing Environment
1. Sufficient lab computers with necessary software (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka).
2. Virtual lab environments for student access from personal devices to mitigate logistical issues.

## III. Software Requirements

### A. Frameworks and Tools
1. **Core Software**
   - Apache Hadoop and Spark for batch and stream processing.
   - Apache Kafka for real-time data handling.
   - IDEs supporting programming languages such as Python, Java, or Scala.

2. **Development and Management Tools**
   - Libraries for machine learning (MLlib in Spark, scikit-learn in Python).
   - Version control systems (e.g., Git) and CI/CD environments for development practices.

### B. Learning Management System
1. Utilization of Canvas for course management, materials, submissions, and compliance with academic policies.

### C. Licensing
1. Ensure all software licenses (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka) are accounted for student access for assignments.

## IV. Scheduling and Facility Limitations

### A. Session Details
1. Deliver courses in 75-minute sessions with careful scheduling in the catalog to avoid conflicts.
2. Schedule hands-on labs requiring additional time for detailed practice.

### B. Classroom Requirements
1. Classrooms equipped to handle technical needs, including adequate electrical outlets and projectors.
2. Align the number of computers with student enrollment, considering smaller or scaled-down sessions if necessary.

### C. Flexibility in Scheduling
1. Offer asynchronous content (video lectures/tutorials) to supplement in-person sessions to accommodate varied student schedules.

## V. TA Support and Limitations

### A. TA Requirements
1. At least one TA for grading and technical support with experience in the course's content and tools.
2. Evaluate the need for additional TAs based on student enrollment and support requirements.

### B. TA Training
1. Prepare the TA in both technical skills and teaching methodologies to effectively assist in labs and student queries.

## VI. Additional Considerations

### A. Feedback Mechanisms
1. Incorporate regular feedback channels (e.g., surveys) to assess teaching effectiveness and student comprehension.

### B. Capstone Project Management
1. Clearly define expectations for the capstone project early in the course, providing guidance and check-in points.

### C. Accessibility Compliance
1. Ensure all course materials meet Stevens accessibility policies, including video captioning and screen reader compatibility.

## Conclusion
The successful delivery of "C6_2 Data Processing at Scale" requires careful attention to faculty expertise, computing resources, software needs, scheduling considerations, TA support, and additional factors. A strategic approach addressing these components will mitigate constraints and enhance the educational experience for students, aligning with institutional objectives and learning outcomes.
