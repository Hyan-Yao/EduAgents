### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Pre-Course Workshops**: 
   - Offer sessions on foundational topics (distributed systems, mathematics for machine learning) prior to the main course.

2. **Ongoing Support**: 
   - Implement weekly Q&A sessions/discussion forums to address lecture materials and provide help with tools.

3. **Varied Instructional Methods**: 
   - Use blended learning approaches, including video tutorials and in-person demonstrations.

4. **Accessible Resources**: 
   - Provide materials (video content) that are easy to understand and support diverse language needs.

5. **Assessment Structure**: 
   - Design assessments around practical projects with peer reviews and iterative feedback to enhance learning.

6. **Enhancing Conceptual Foundations**: 
   - Introduce pre-course readings/resource modules to bridge knowledge gaps on key topics.

7. **Incorporating Collaborative Learning**: 
   - Create structured peer-learning groups to foster collaboration and networking.

8. **Frequent Feedback Loops**: 
   - Incorporate low-stakes assessments/check-ins for timely feedback on student comprehension.

9. **Capstone Project Guidance**: 
   - Offer structured guidance and interim milestones for capstone projects to alleviate anxiety.

10. **Support Structures for Diverse Learning Needs**: 
    - Provide language support and workshops on tools (MapReduce, Spark) early in the semester.

11. **Adjusting Course Pacing and Delivery**: 
    - Consider a flipped classroom model to allow students to engage with materials at their own pace before class discussions.

12. **Leveraging Technology for Engagement**: 
    - Use interactive learning platforms for quizzes and discussions, promoting real-time understanding.

13. **Feedback Mechanisms Beyond Surveys**: 
    - Implement mid-semester evaluations for proactive course adjustments based on student feedback. 

By adapting the course structure in these ways, we can better accommodate student needs, enhance their learning experience, and facilitate their mastery of data processing at scale.
