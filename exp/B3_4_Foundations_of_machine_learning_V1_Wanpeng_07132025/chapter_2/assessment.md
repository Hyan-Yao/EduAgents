  A) Imputation of missing values
  B) Outlier detection
  C) Normalization of features
  D) Numeric data conversion

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Normalization of features is part of data transformation, not specifically data cleaning.

**Question 3:** What effect does feature engineering have on machine learning models?

  A) It makes the models simpler
  B) It can drastically improve model accuracy
  C) It complicates the model training process
  D) It has no effect on model performance

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Well-engineered features can significantly enhance the predictive power and accuracy of machine learning models.

**Question 4:** Why is handling missing data an important step in preprocessing?

  A) It increases the data volume
  B) It ensures every data point can be analyzed
  C) It prevents the model from overfitting
  D) It introduces biases in the data

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Handling missing data ensures that all relevant information is considered, allowing the model to be trained without losing potentially valuable insights.

### Activities
- Perform a small data preprocessing exercise on a sample dataset. Identify missing values, outliers, and implement techniques such as normalization and feature engineering.
- Create a flowchart illustrating the data preprocessing steps you think are most critical in preparing data for a machine learning model.
