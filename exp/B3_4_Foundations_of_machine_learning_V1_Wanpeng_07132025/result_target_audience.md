Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

### 1) Comprehensive Profile of Target Students

**Typical Student Background**
- **Total Students:** Approximately 150.
- **Student Level:** Primarily undergraduate students.
- **International/Domestic Ratio:** About 60% international and 40% domestic students.
- **Academic Background:** Mostly from Computer Science, with representation from engineering disciplines such as Electrical and Industrial.

**Prerequisite Knowledge**
- **Programming Skills:** Foundation in Python is expected. Variability in comfort levels, especially with Google Colab.
- **Mathematical Understanding:** Basic proficiency in probability, linear algebra, and optimization is ideal, but many students exhibit gaps in these areas.
- **Exposure to Machine Learning:** Varying degrees of exposure to machine learning concepts, with some students entirely new to the field.

**Career Aspirations**
- Students pursue careers in technology, data science, machine learning, or AI, emphasizing practical applications of machine learning.

**Potential Knowledge Gaps and Learning Needs**
1. **Programming Confidence:** Lack of uniformity in programming skills, particularly with tools like Google Colab.
2. **Concept Gaps:** Limited familiarity with fundamental machine learning concepts like supervised/unsupervised learning and neural networks.
3. **Tool Gaps:** Inconsistent experience with machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn).
4. **Language Needs:** International students may require simplified instructions and resources.
5. **Math Background:** Conditional gaps in critical mathematical concepts affecting machine learning understanding.

### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Clarified Learning Objectives:** Focus course objectives on practical application and significance of machine learning concepts rather than theoretical math complexities.
  
2. **Revamped Syllabus:** Remove mentions of basic programming and ethics, introduce more data-related topics, aligning the content with students' career aspirations in AI and machine learning.

3. **Interactive Learning Strategies:** Incorporate live demonstrations, group discussions, and collaborative projects to engage students in real-world applications of machine learning.

4. **Problem-Based Learning:** Shift towards project-based assessments, allowing for practical knowledge application, reducing reliance on high-stakes exams.

5. **Structured Tutorials and Resources:** Provide early access to tutorials and resources focusing on tool usage, data handling, and foundational math concepts for self-paced learning.

6. **Ongoing Feedback Mechanisms:** Implement regular check-ins with students to assess their understanding and allow for course adjustments and targeted assistance when needed.
