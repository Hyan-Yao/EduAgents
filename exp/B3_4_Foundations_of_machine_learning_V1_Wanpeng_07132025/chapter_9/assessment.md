- Encourage active engagement in discussing how unsupervised learning can be applied in practice.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the primary goal of unsupervised learning?

  A) To predict outcomes based on labeled data
  B) To uncover hidden patterns in unlabeled data
  C) To classify data into predefined categories
  D) To enhance supervised learning models

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The primary goal of unsupervised learning is to uncover hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

**Question 2:** Which of the following techniques is used for dimensionality reduction?

  A) K-Means Clustering
  B) Decision Trees
  C) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  D) Linear Regression

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique that reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining most variability.

**Question 3:** What does K-Means Clustering aim to achieve?

  A) Produce a deterministic mapping of features to classes
  B) Group data into k distinct clusters based on similarity
  C) Predict future data points with accuracy
  D) Identify outliers in data

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** K-Means Clustering aims to group data into k distinct clusters based on feature similarity.

**Question 4:** In which scenario is unsupervised learning particularly useful?

  A) Predicting future sales based on past data
  B) Identifying customer segments in a marketing database
  C) Detecting spam emails
  D) Classifying images into categories

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Unsupervised learning is particularly useful for identifying customer segments in a marketing database, as it analyzes patterns in unlabeled data.

### Activities
- Conduct a group discussion where students brainstorm real-world applications of unsupervised learning and present their findings.
- Create a visual representation (like a chart or infographic) showing how K-Means clustering works with a hypothetical dataset.

### Discussion Questions
- How can unsupervised learning techniques be integrated into existing data workflows within industries?
- What are the limitations of unsupervised learning that practitioners should be aware of?
- Can you think of a dataset that might benefit from unsupervised learning techniques? What insights could be gained?
