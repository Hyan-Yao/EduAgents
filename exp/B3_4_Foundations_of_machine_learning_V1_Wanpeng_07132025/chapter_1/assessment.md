  A) Learning from labeled data
  B) Learning without any data
  C) Learning from unlabeled data
  D) Avoiding data entirely

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Supervised learning involves training models with labeled datasets, allowing them to make predictions based on that data.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is an example of unsupervised learning?

  A) Text classification
  B) Customer segmentation
  C) Email spam filtering
  D) Stock price prediction

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Customer segmentation is a classic example of unsupervised learning, where patterns are identified in data without predefined labels.

**Question 3:** Which evaluation metric is used to assess the performance of a classification model?

  A) Mean Absolute Error
  B) F1 Score
  C) Root Mean Squared Error
  D) R-squared

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The F1 Score is a commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of classification models, balancing precision and recall.

**Question 4:** What is an ethical consideration in machine learning?

  A) Increasing model accuracy
  B) Reducing dataset size
  C) Addressing bias in algorithms
  D) Maximizing computational speed

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Addressing bias in algorithms is critical to ensure fairness and equity in machine learning applications.

**Question 5:** In the context of machine learning, what is a confusion matrix used for?

  A) To visualize the architecture of a neural network
  B) To assess the accuracy of regression models
  C) To evaluate the performance of classification models
  D) To train unsupervised models

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** A confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of a classification model's performance, showing true positives, false positives, etc.
