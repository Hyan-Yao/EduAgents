# Final Project Plan: Data-Driven Solutions in Real-World AI Applications

### Project Description
Students will collaboratively develop a machine learning project that addresses a real-world data-related issue. This project emphasizes the application of concepts learned throughout the "Foundations of Machine Learning" course, integrating theoretical understanding with practical skills in data quality and artificial intelligence.

### Objectives
- Apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
- Enhance critical thinking and analytical skills.
- Foster collaboration and teamwork among students.
- Analyze data quality and its relevance in AI applications.

### Timeline with Milestones

1. **Project Proposal** (Week 12)
   - Outline the problem, dataset, and approach.
   - **Deliverable**: PDF proposal.
   
2. **Progress Report** (Week 14)
   - Share progress on data preprocessing, model selection, and challenges.
   - **Deliverable**: PDF report and presentation slides.

3. **Final Deliverable** (Week 16)
   - Comprehensive documentation of the machine learning process, including data exploration, model training, evaluation metrics, and presentation.
   - **Deliverable**: Final report (PDF) and code files (.ipynb).

### Deliverables
- **Week 12**: Project Proposal (PDF)
- **Week 14**: Progress Report (PDF) and Presentation
- **Week 16**: Final Report (PDF) and Code Files (.ipynb)
