    \frametitle{How Neural Networks Work - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Overview of Neural Network Processes}
        Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). 
        The training process has two key stages:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Forward Propagation}
            \item \textbf{Backward Propagation}
        \end{itemize}
        Understanding these processes is essential for grasping how neural networks learn from data.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{How Neural Networks Work - Forward Propagation}
    \begin{block}{1. Forward Propagation}
        \textbf{Definition:} Input data passes through the network layer by layer to produce an output.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Input Layer:} Raw data is fed into the neural network.
            \item \textbf{Hidden Layers:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Neurons apply a weighted sum and pass the result through an activation function.
                \item \textbf{Example:} Prediction of house price.
                \begin{equation}
                    Z = (Weight_1 \times Size) + (Weight_2 \times Location) + Bias
                \end{equation}
                \begin{equation}
                    Output = ActivationFunction(Z)
                \end{equation}
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Output Layer:} The final output generates the prediction.
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{Key Point:} Activation functions introduce non-linearity.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{How Neural Networks Work - Backward Propagation}
    \begin{block}{2. Backward Propagation}
        \textbf{Definition:} Updating weights based on the error of predicted vs. actual output.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Calculate Loss:} Determine error using a loss function.
            \begin{equation}
                Loss = \frac{1}{n} \sum (Predicted - Actual)^2
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Gradient Descent:} Adjust weights to minimize loss.
            \begin{equation}
                Weight_{new} = Weight_{old} - (Learning\_Rate \times \frac{\partial Loss}{\partial Weight})
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example:} If predicted price is \$300,000 and the actual price is \$320,000, error calculation leads to weight adjustment.
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{Key Points:} Backward propagation enhances the model and leads to improved accuracy.

    \begin{block}{Summary}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Forward Propagation:} Processes input through layers to generate output.
            \item \textbf{Backward Propagation:} Compares output with actual results, calculates loss, and updates weights.
        \end{itemize}
        The combination of these processes allows neural networks to learn patterns from data and make predictions. 
    \end{block}

    \frametitle{Challenges in Neural Networks}
    Neural networks are powerful tools for machine learning but face challenges that affect their performance. Understanding these is crucial for building effective models. Key challenges include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Overfitting
        \item Underfitting
        \item Vanishing Gradient Problem
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Overfitting}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise rather than true patterns. 
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Training a model to recognize handwritten digits may lead to memorizing specific images, causing poor performance on new data.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Solution}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Cross-validation: Monitor model performance on validation sets.
            \item Regularization: Use L1 and L2 regularization to penalize large weights.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

            \item \textbf{Example}: A linear model predicting non-linear trends, like stock prices.
            \item \textbf{Solution}: Increase model complexity and perform feature engineering to capture complexity.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Vanishing Gradient Problem}

            \item \textbf{Definition}: Gradients become very small during backpropagation, slowing training.
            \item \textbf{Example}: Deep networks may stop learning if early layers get tiny gradients.
            \item \textbf{Solution}: Use ReLU activation and batch normalization to maintain consistent gradients.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Evaluating Neural Network Performance - Key Metrics}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Accuracy}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Measures proportion of correct predictions:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Number of Predictions}} 
            \end{equation}
            \item Example: 90 out of 100 correct predictions results in 90\% accuracy.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Precision}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Measures positive-predicted accuracy:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}} 
            \end{equation}
            \item Example: 20 true positives and 10 false positives yields:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Precision} = \frac{20}{30} \approx 0.67
            \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Recall}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Measures the ability to capture actual positives:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}} 
            \end{equation}
            \item Example: 20 true positives out of 50 actual positives results in:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Recall} = \frac{20}{50} = 0.4
            \end{equation}
