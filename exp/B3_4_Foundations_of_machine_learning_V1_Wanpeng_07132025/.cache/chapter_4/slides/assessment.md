**Explanation:** The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, making it particularly useful when evaluating models on imbalanced datasets.

**Question 3:** Which of the following is a common challenge in machine learning model implementation?

  A) High performance on unseen data
  B) Underfitting
  C) Easy data acquisition
  D) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Underfitting occurs when a model is too simplistic to capture the underlying trend in the data, leading to poor performance.

**Question 4:** What is one crucial aspect of ensuring the effectiveness of supervised learning models?

  A) Data accessibility
  B) Data quality and preprocessing
  C) Using complex algorithms
  D) Focusing solely on accuracy

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Data quality and preprocessing are essential for the success of supervised learning models, as they directly impact the performance of the model.

### Activities
- Create a short presentation summarizing the key takeaways from the chapter, highlighting the main concepts of supervised learning, challenges, and real-world applications.
- Select a dataset and outline a preprocessing plan that includes data cleaning, feature selection, and transformation steps before applying a supervised learning model.

### Discussion Questions
- How might bias in data influence the outcomes of machine learning models you are exposed to?
- Can you identify a real-world scenario where a supervised learning model might inadvertently perpetuate existing inequalities?
