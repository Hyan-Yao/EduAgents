        \item \textbf{Identifying Overfitting and Underfitting:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Evaluation on a validation set reveals if a model is overfitting (too complex) or underfitting (too simplistic).
                \item Illustration: A model performing well on training data but poorly on validation data is overfitted.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Choosing the Best Model:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Helps in systematically identifying the best model from multiple candidates.
                \item Example: Evaluating three algorithms for predicting house prices on the same test set aids in choosing the most effective one.
            \end{itemize}
