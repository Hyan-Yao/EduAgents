        \item \textbf{Decision Trees}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: A flowchart-like structure with feature tests as internal nodes, and outcomes as branches leading to class labels at leaf nodes.
            \item \textbf{How It Works}: Recursively splits data based on characteristics that yield the most information gain.
            \item \textbf{Example}: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Classifying if a person will enjoy a movie based on age, gender, and preferences. 
                \item If under 18, the tree may predict "likely to enjoy animated films."

        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{What is a Decision Tree?}
    \begin{block}{Understanding Decision Trees}
        A \textbf{Decision Tree} is a widely used machine learning model for classification and regression. 
        It imitates human decision-making by simplifying complex decisions into a series of easier choices.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Structure of a Decision Tree}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Root Node}: The top node representing the initial decision point.
        \item \textbf{Internal Nodes}: Points representing decisions based on feature values; branches correspond to decision rules.
        \item \textbf{Branches}: Connections between nodes that represent outcomes of decisions.
        \item \textbf{Leaf Nodes}: Terminal nodes that provide the final output or classification result.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{How Decision Trees Function}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Splitting}: Dataset is split at the root node based on the best feature for predicting the target variable.
        \item \textbf{Decision Rules}: Decisions based on feature values are made as data progresses down the tree.
        \item \textbf{Stopping Criteria}: Splitting stops based on conditions like maximum depth or minimum samples per leaf.
        \item \textbf{Prediction}: The leaf node reached determines the predicted class for input data.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Decision Trees Example}
    Imagine predicting if someone will go for a walk based on weather conditions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Root Node}: Is it sunny?
        \item \textbf{Branch 1}: Yes → Is it windy?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Leaf Node 1: If Yes → Don't go for a walk.
                \item Leaf Node 2: If No → Go for a walk.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Branch 2}: No → Go for a walk.
    \end{enumerate}
    This illustrates how decisions lead to outcomes based on given criteria.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Limitations of Decision Trees - Introduction}
  While decision trees are popular tools for classification tasks due to their simplicity and interpretability, they also come with several limitations that can impact model performance. Understanding these limitations is crucial for effective model selection and application.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Limitations of Decision Trees - Part 1}
  \begin{block}{1. Overfitting}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Explanation}: Decision trees can create overly complex models that fit the training data very well but generalize poorly to unseen data.
      \item \textbf{Example}: If a decision tree is too deep, it may capture noise instead of the actual underlying pattern, leading to high accuracy on training data but poor accuracy on test data.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Illustration}: A decision tree with many branches may perfectly classify training examples but fails to predict future variants.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Limitations of Decision Trees - Part 2}
  \begin{block}{2. Instability}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Explanation}: Small changes in the data can result in completely different tree structures, making the model sensitive to fluctuations in the input data.
      \item \textbf{Example}: Adding or removing a few data points may lead to a different split at a critical junction, changing the entire outcome of classifications.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{3. Biased with Imbalanced Data}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Explanation}: Decision trees can be biased towards the majority class if the dataset is imbalanced.
      \item \textbf{Example}: In a dataset with 90\% of examples belonging to Class A and only 10\% to Class B, the tree may favor Class A and misclassify many examples of Class B.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Key Point}: Always assess class distribution and consider techniques to handle imbalanced datasets.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Limitations of Decision Trees - Part 3}
  \begin{block}{4. Difficulty in Capturing Relationships}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Explanation}: Decision trees often struggle to model complex relationships and interactions between features, splitting data based on single features at a time.
      \item \textbf{Example}: If two variables interact (e.g., age and income affecting purchase behavior), a simple decision tree may miss the nuances that a more sophisticated model could capture.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{5. Computational Intensity}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Explanation}: For large datasets, finding the best splits can be computationally expensive.
      \item \textbf{Example}: As the number of features and data points increases, the tree-building process may require significant time and resources, especially for deep trees.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{6. Lack of Elasticity for Predictions}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Explanation}: Decision trees provide discrete classes or predictions instead of probabilities, limiting the understanding of confidence in predictions.
      \item \textbf{Example}: If a decision tree predicts whether a borrower will default (Yes/No), it does not indicate the probability of defaulting, crucial for applications like finance.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Limitations of Decision Trees - Summary and Next Steps}
  Understanding these limitations is essential for improving model performance and ensuring robust decision-making. In practice, combining decision trees with ensemble methods, such as random forests or boosting algorithms, can mitigate many of these challenges.

  \textbf{Takeaway Question}: How can awareness of these limitations guide your choice of algorithms for your next classification project?

  \textbf{Next Steps}: In the upcoming slide, we will explore the process of building a decision tree model and discuss optimal splitting criteria to enhance decision-making accuracy.

    \begin{block}{Overview}
        A Decision Tree is a popular machine learning model used for classification and regression tasks. 
        Its structure resembles a flowchart, where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Each internal node represents a feature (attribute),
            \item Each branch represents a decision rule,
            \item Each leaf node represents an outcome.

    \frametitle{Building a Decision Tree - Data Preparation}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Data Preparation:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Collect Data:} Ensure you have a dataset relevant to the problem you're solving (e.g., predicting whether a customer will buy a product).
                \item \textbf{Clean Data:} Handle missing values and outliers to improve the quality of the model.
                \item \textbf{Feature Selection:} Identify the most relevant features that will be used for splitting, based on domain knowledge or exploratory data analysis.

    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
        \item \textbf{Splitting the Data:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Splitting Criteria:}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Gini Index:} Measures impurity. Lower values indicate better splits.
                        \item \textbf{Information Gain (Entropy):} Measures how much information is gained from a split. Higher values indicate more informative splits.
                        \item \textbf{Mean Squared Error (for regression tasks):} Assesses the reduction in variance after splitting.
                    \end{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Example:} Splitting based on income could create groups of low, medium, and high income for predicting loan approval.
            \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Building the Tree Structure:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The tree is built recursively:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Evaluate all candidate splits using the selected criterion.
                        \item Choose the best split which maximizes information gain or minimizes impurity.
                        \item Create child nodes for each possible value of the selected feature.
                    \end{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Stopping Criteria:}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item All instances in a node belong to the same class.
                        \item No more features to split on.
                        \item A predefined depth of the tree is reached or the node contains fewer than a certain number of samples.
                    \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
        \item \textbf{Pruning the Tree:}
            \begin{itemize}
