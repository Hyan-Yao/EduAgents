\frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Traditional methods like Decision Trees and Random Forests remain robust, but evolving techniques such as deep learning are transforming classification tasks.
        \item Future advancements should emphasize not only accuracy and efficiency but also the ethical implications of the models we build.
        \item Integrating explainability and interpretability can foster trust in AI systems among both developers and users.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Discussion Prompt:} What measures should we implement to ensure our classification models operate fairly across diverse populations?
