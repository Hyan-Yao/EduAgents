**Explanation:** Random Forests are comprised of multiple trees, making the overall model less interpretable than a single Decision Tree.

### Activities
- Prepare a presentation summarizing the key advantages and disadvantages of both Decision Trees and Random Forests. Focus on real-world applications and provide examples.
- Using a dataset of your choice, implement both a Decision Tree and a Random Forest model in Python. Compare their performance and present your findings.

### Discussion Questions
- In what scenarios would you prefer using Decision Trees over Random Forests?
- How does the complexity of a model impact the selection process in machine learning?
- Can you think of a specific industry where the interpretability of a Decision Tree would be crucial? Why?
