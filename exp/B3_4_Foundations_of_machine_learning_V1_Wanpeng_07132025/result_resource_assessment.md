Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource and Constraints Assessment for "Foundations of Machine Learning" Course Delivery

## Faculty Expertise Requirements

### Knowledge and Skills
1. **Machine Learning Proficiency**: The instructor needs a solid understanding of machine learning concepts, including practical applications and emerging data-related issues in AI.
2. **Teaching Experience**: Experience with undergraduate instruction is crucial, emphasizing foundational knowledge rather than advanced mathematical theories. Familiarity with ethical considerations in AI is also beneficial.
3. **Professional Development**: Recommendations for workshops to enhance knowledge around data and its relationship with AI could be advantageous.

### Adaptability and Communication
- The faculty must demonstrate adaptability in teaching strategies and clear communication to accommodate various student understanding levels.

## Necessary Computing Resources

### Hardware
1. **Student Laptops**: Verify that all students possess reliable laptops capable of running necessary software and accessing online tools. Conducting a pre-course survey can identify students needing additional resources.

### Software Requirements
1. **Learning Management System (LMS)**: Proficiency in Canvas is essential for both faculty and students to manage assignments, discussions, and track progress.
2. **Google Colab**: Familiarity with Colab as a collaborative programming environment is necessary. A guided tutorial at the course start is recommended.
3. **Data Libraries**: Ensure student access to essential Python libraries for machine learning in Google Colab. Provide resources for importing and utilizing these libraries effectively.

## Scheduling Constraints

### Class Structure
1. **Session Planning**: The 75-minute class must balance lectures and labs, ensuring engaging pacing while avoiding cognitive overload.

### TA Support
1. **Limited Availability**: Given the TA's restricted hours, maximize their effectiveness during these times through arranged review sessions or focused Q&A discussions.

### Workload Distribution
1. **Curriculum Balance**: The removal of topics like programming basics and ethics must not lead to an unmanageable increase in workload from other areas. Careful syllabus design is crucial.

## Facility Limitations

### Classroom Setup
- **AV Equipment**: Ensure the classroom is equipped with necessary audiovisual equipment for presentations and interactive demonstrations. Assess the physical space for its adequacy in facilitating collaboration and engagement.

### Maximum Slide Count
- A limit of 50 slides necessitates concise presentations focusing on essential concepts while integrating interactive elements to encourage application-based learning.

## Recommendations for Effective Course Delivery

1. **Revise Learning Objectives**: Adjust objectives to emphasize practical applications and the importance of data in machine learning and AI, minimizing emphasis on mathematical complexities.
  
2. **Syllabus Overhaul**: Tailor the syllabus to address feedback, ensuring integration of data-related topics while eliminating sections on programming basics and ethics. Ensure clear communication regarding course expectations and adherence to ASU policies.

3. **Interactive Learning Activities**: Implement live demonstrations, group discussions, and collaborative problem-solving strategies to enhance student engagement. Utilize real-world data sets for projects to maintain relevance.

4. **Supplemental Resource Material**: Provide students with curated resources—tutorials, documentation, and best practices for using Google Colab—at the beginning of the course to facilitate the learning curve.

5. **Set Clear Communication Channels**: Establish and communicate clear protocols regarding office hours, TA support expectations, and methods for students to seek help with assignments or technical issues.

## Conclusion
By focusing on faculty preparation, defining resource needs, accommodating scheduling constraints, and optimizing course structure for student engagement, the "Foundations of Machine Learning" course can be successfully delivered. These measures will ensure alignment with student needs and institutional policies.
