    \begin{block}{What is Bagging?}
        Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble method that enhances the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms. It primarily targets variance reduction, thereby mitigating overfitting. By leveraging the predictions of multiple models, bagging generates a more stable and reliable final output.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Bagging Explained - The Process}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Bootstrap Sampling:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Create multiple subsets of the training data by randomly sampling with replacement.
            \item Each subset is of the same size as the original dataset, but some instances may appear multiple times while others may be omitted.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Training Models:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Train an individual model (commonly of the same type) on each of the bootstrapped samples.
            \item For instance, if decision trees are used, each tree will be trained on a different subset.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Aggregation:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Predictions from each model are collected.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item For regression tasks: Average the predictions.
                \item For classification tasks: Use majority voting to determine the final class label.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Bagging Explained - Example and Key Points}
    \begin{block}{Example Scenario}
        Predicting whether a person will purchase a product based on age, income, and previous purchase history:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Create 5 samples and train decision trees on each.
            \item Each tree provides a prediction (“Yes” or “No”) for a new customer.
            \item Aggregate predictions: If 3 out of 5 trees predict “Yes”, the final prediction is “Yes”.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
