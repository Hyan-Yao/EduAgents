### Activities
- Explore public Kaggle notebooks that utilize ensemble methods. Analyze the methodologies used in their implementations and present your findings to the class.
- Select a dataset (e.g., Iris or Titanic) and use Scikit-learn to implement at least two different ensemble methods. Compare their performance metrics and discuss the outcomes.

### Discussion Questions
- What challenges have you faced when applying ensemble methods in practical scenarios?
- How might the diversity of models in an ensemble contribute to its overall performance?
- Can you think of other real-world applications where ensemble methods could be beneficial?
