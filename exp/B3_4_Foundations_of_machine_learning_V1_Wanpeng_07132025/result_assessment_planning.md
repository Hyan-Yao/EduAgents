Assessment & Evaluation Planning
================================

# Assessment and Evaluation Plan for "Foundations of Machine Learning"

## Overview
This assessment plan is designed to facilitate project-based learning and real-world applications of machine learning concepts through continuous evaluations via homework, projects, and presentations, replacing traditional exams with cumulative project deliverables.
