Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan: Data Processing Pipeline for Real-World Scenarios

## Course Title:
Data Processing at Scale  
**Course Code**: CS 305  
**Credits**: 3  

---

## Project Description:
The final project involves designing, implementing, and evaluating an end-to-end data processing pipeline using real-world datasets and appropriate processing frameworks, such as Apache Spark or Hadoop. Students will work collaboratively in teams, simulating a real-world project environment to apply their analytical and technical skills.

---

## Objectives:
1. Design a data processing pipeline that can handle large datasets effectively.
2. Implement data processing methodologies using modern frameworks.
3. Collaborate effectively within a team setting while fulfilling individual roles and responsibilities.
4. Analyze data to derive meaningful insights and present findings convincingly.
5. Uphold academic integrity throughout the project lifecycle.

## Academic Integrity Guidelines:
- All submissions must adhere to academic integrity standards. Any incidences of plagiarism or cheating will lead to disciplinary actions.
- Collaboration is allowed, but each student must contribute to the final report and code implementation separately and individually.

---

## Team Structure:
- **Team-Based Work**: Teams of 3-5 members.
- **Role Distribution**: Team members must take on specific roles to enhance teamwork and responsibility.
- **Peer Evaluation**: Students will assess teammates to promote accountability.

---

## Technology and Submission Logistics:
- **Submission Formats**:
  - Final Report: .pdf
  - Code Implementation: .ipynb
  - Presentation: .pptx or .pdf
- **Submission Platform**: All deliverables should be uploaded to Canvas by the provided deadlines.

---

## Feedback Mechanisms:
- Feedback will be provided at each milestone from instructors and peers. 
- Anonymous feedback surveys will be used for continuous improvement of project design.
