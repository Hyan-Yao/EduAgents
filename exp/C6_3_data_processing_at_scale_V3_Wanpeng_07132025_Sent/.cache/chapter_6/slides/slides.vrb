\frametitle{Group By and Having Clauses - Example}
    Consider a \texttt{sales} table with the following fields: \texttt{product_id}, \texttt{salesperson}, and \texttt{amount}.

    \begin{lstlisting}
| product_id | salesperson | amount |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| 1          | Alice       | 100    |
| 1          | Bob         | 150    |
| 2          | Alice       | 200    |
| 2          | Bob         | 300    |
| 1          | Alice       | 50     |
    \end{lstlisting}

    \textbf{Objective}: Find total sales per salesperson and only include those with total sales greater than $200.

    \begin{block}{SQL Query}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
SELECT salesperson, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY salesperson
HAVING SUM(amount) > 200;
    \end{lstlisting}
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Result}:
    \begin{lstlisting}
| salesperson | total_sales |
|-------------|-------------|
| Bob         | 450         |
    \end{lstlisting}
