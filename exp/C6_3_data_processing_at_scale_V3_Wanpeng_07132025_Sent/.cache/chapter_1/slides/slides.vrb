\frametitle{Conclusion and Key Points}
    In assessing data processing methodologies, you should consider:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tailoring methodology selection to data characteristics (type \& volume).
        \item The importance of speed (batch vs. real-time).
        \item Matching complexity to team proficiency.
        \item Ensuring scalability for future data growth.
        \item Seamless integration with existing systems.
        \item Balancing costs with usability.
    \end{itemize}
