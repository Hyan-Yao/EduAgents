# Final Project Plan Document

### Project Title: Data Mining Challenge: Real-World Dataset Analysis

---

## 1. Project Description
Students will collaboratively work in small teams to analyze a real-world dataset, applying data mining techniques learned throughout the course. The final project will consist of various milestones: project proposal, progress report, and a final report and presentation. The project should demonstrate an understanding of data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and the application of ethical considerations.

## 2. Objectives
- To apply data mining techniques to a real-world dataset.
- To enhance collaborative teamwork and communication skills.
- To develop analytical thinking through problem-solving with data.
- To understand and discuss ethical considerations in data usage.

## 3. Timeline with Milestones
| Milestone                         | Due Date                | Percentage of Final Grade |
