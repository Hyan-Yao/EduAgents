### Course Learning Objectives for A1_4_Data_Mining:

1. **Application of Core Techniques**: 
   - Students will be able to apply key data mining techniques, including classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, to analyze real-world datasets effectively.

2. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Students will critically evaluate the performance of various models using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, making recommendations for technique selection based on evaluation results.

3. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing**: 
   - Students will demonstrate proficiency in exploring, visualizing, normalizing, and extracting features from datasets to prepare data for modeling processes.

4. **Implementation of Algorithms**: 
   - Students will implement and experiment with a range of supervised learning algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, ensemble methods, and neural networks, in Python.

5. **Exploration of Advanced Topics**: 
   - Students will investigate and apply more advanced data mining techniques, including generative models, text mining, and reinforcement learning, to meet complex data analysis needs.

6. **Group Collaboration and Presentation Skills**: 
   - Students will collaborate effectively in teams to complete a group project that encompasses the creation, evaluation, and presentation of a data mining solution, comprising a significant portion of the course grade.

7. **Awareness of Ethical Standards**: 
   - Students will understand and adhere to ethical standards in data mining practices, including issues related to data privacy, proper usage of data mining techniques, and compliance with institutional academic integrity policies.
