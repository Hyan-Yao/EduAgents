## Course Learning Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Apply key data mining techniques (classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection) to analyze real-world datasets.
2. Evaluate the performance of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, and select appropriate techniques based on results.
3. Demonstrate proficiency in data preprocessing, including exploration, visualization, normalization, and feature extraction.
4. Implement supervised learning algorithms in Python, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, ensemble methods, and neural networks.
5. Investigate advanced data mining techniques, such as generative models, text mining, and reinforcement learning.
6. Collaborate effectively while completing a group project that requires creating, evaluating, and presenting a data mining solution.
7. Understand ethical standards and issues related to data mining practices, including data privacy and academic integrity.
