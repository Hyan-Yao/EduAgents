\frametitle{Overfitting and Regularization - Key Points and Summary}
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Overfitting is detrimental as it leads to poor generalization on unseen data.
            \item Regularization techniques, such as L2 regularization and dropout, are effective ways to combat overfitting.
            \item Monitoring model performance on validation data is crucial for detecting overfitting early.
