### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** Why is data preprocessing important in data mining?

  A) To visualize the dataset
  B) To ensure the quality and accuracy of the data
  C) To conduct market research
  D) To implement advanced algorithms

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Data preprocessing is critical as it enhances the quality and accuracy of the dataset, thus leading to better machine learning model performance.

**Question 2:** What is the first step in preparing data for supervised learning?

  A) Running machine learning models
  B) Data exploration
  C) Model evaluation
  D) Data visualization

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Data exploration is the first step that helps identify patterns, outliers, and relationships within the data, setting the stage for further preprocessing.

**Question 3:** Which of the following techniques involves dealing with missing values during preprocessing?

  A) Normalization
  B) Data splitting
  C) Imputation
  D) Feature selection

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Imputation is the technique used to handle missing values by filling them with substituted values based on other observations in the dataset.

**Question 4:** What type of data is required for supervised learning algorithms?

  A) Labeled data
  B) Unlabeled data
  C) Semi-supervised data
  D) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Supervised learning algorithms require labeled data to learn the relationship between input features and output labels during training.

### Activities
- Create a dataset and perform data exploration using Pandas to identify at least three patterns or trends.
