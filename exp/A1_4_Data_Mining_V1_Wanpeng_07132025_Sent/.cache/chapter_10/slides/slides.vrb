\frametitle{Applications and Discussion Questions}
    \textbf{Examples to Illustrate Concepts}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data Visualization}: Use PCA to reduce hundreds of features to two dimensions, aiding pattern and outlier identification.
        \item \textbf{Real-World Application}: Utilize autoencoders in image processing, like facial recognition systems enhancing user experience (e.g., ChatGPT).
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Engagement Activity}:
    Encourage students to share thoughts on dimensionality reduction in their projects to promote collaborative learning.

    \textbf{Discussion Questions}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Why is dimensionality reduction increasingly relevant in the age of big data?
        \item Can you provide examples from your field where dimensionality reduction is beneficial?
        \item How do recent AI applications (e.g., ChatGPT) leverage data mining techniques, including dimensionality reduction?
    \end{enumerate}
