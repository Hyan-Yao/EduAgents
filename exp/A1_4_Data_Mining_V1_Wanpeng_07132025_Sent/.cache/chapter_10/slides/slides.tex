\begin{frame}[fragile]{Why Do We Need Dimensionality Reduction?}
    \begin{block}{Understanding Dimensionality Reduction}
        Dimensionality Reduction (DR) refers to the technique of reducing the number of input variables in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. 
        It is essential in various data analysis fields to simplify models and maximize efficiency.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Key Motivations for Dimensionality Reduction}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mitigating the Curse of Dimensionality
        \item Improving Model Performance
        \item Enabling Data Visualization
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Mitigating the Curse of Dimensionality}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        The "curse of dimensionality" refers to challenges that arise when analyzing high-dimensional data, often leading to overfitting.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Explanation}
        In high dimensions, data points become sparse, making it difficult for algorithms to generalize. For example, with 100 features, the space increases exponentially, leading to increased distances between points.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        A model trained on image data with thousands of pixels may learn noise rather than significant patterns without DR techniques.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Improving Model Performance}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        DR can reduce complexity by filtering out noise and irrelevant features, resulting in faster and more accurate models.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Explanation}
        Eliminating redundant features allows models to concentrate on significant information, improving accuracy and reducing computation time.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can transform a dataset into its most informative components, enhancing performance for algorithms like Support Vector Machines or Logistic Regression.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Enabling Data Visualization}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        Visualizing high-dimensional data is challenging as it is difficult to display more than 3 dimensions clearly.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Explanation}
        DR projects data into lower dimensions (typically 2D or 3D) for easier interpretation and insight generation.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is frequently used to visualize complex datasets, allowing for the visualization of clusters or trends.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{What is PCA?}
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transforms a dataset with many variables into a new dataset with fewer variables, retaining as much information as possible. These fewer variables are called principal components.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

            \begin{equation}
            Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
            \end{equation}

        \item \textbf{Covariance Matrix:} Captures how variables vary together:
            \begin{equation}
            C = \frac{1}{n-1} Z^T Z
            \end{equation}

        \item \textbf{Sensitivity to Scaling:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Sensitive to data scale; standardization is crucial before applying PCA.
                \item \textit{Example:} Income (thousands) and age (years) on different scales can bias results.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Potential for Information Loss:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Choosing the number of components to retain can lead to important information being discarded.
                \item \textit{Illustration:} Using only top components may impair differentiation of class insights.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
