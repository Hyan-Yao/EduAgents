\frametitle{Key Components of Reinforcement Learning}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item **Agent**: The learner or decision maker.
        \item **Environment**: Everything the agent interacts with; provides feedback.
        \item **Actions (A)**: Choices the agent can make at any given state.
        \item **States (S)**: Different situations or configurations of the environment.
        \item **Rewards (R)**: Feedback received after taking an action; positive or negative.
        \item **Policy (π)**: A strategy that defines the agent’s behavior; can be deterministic or stochastic.
    \end{enumerate}
