### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Develop Supplementary Resources:**
   - Create and distribute additional learning materials (tutorials, guides) focusing on Python and introductory data mining techniques, ensuring content is accessible for students with varying backgrounds.

2. **Enhance Instructional Clarity:**
   - Simplify instructional content and utilize visuals to aid comprehension. Consider offering language support or additional tutorials for English language learners.

3. **Adjust Course Pacing:**
   - Reassess the course schedule to include a slower pace during the initial weeks, allowing for thorough coverage of foundational programming and mathematical concepts before moving on to complex topics.

4. **Implement Real-Time Support:**
   - Ensure TA availability for extended hours during the early parts of the course. Establish dedicated office hours focusing specifically on tool usage and algorithm understanding.

5. **Emphasize Project-Based Assessment:**
   - Reinforce project-oriented assessments and possibly incorporate group projects to facilitate collaboration and enhance engagement. Gather ongoing feedback to ensure these projects align with student learning needs and career aspirations.
