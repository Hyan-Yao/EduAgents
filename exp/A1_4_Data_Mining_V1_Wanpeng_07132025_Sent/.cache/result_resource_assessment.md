Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: "A1_4_Data_Mining"

## Faculty Expertise Requirements:
### 1. Subject Matter Expertise:
- **Required Knowledge Areas**:
  - Proficient in data mining techniques and methodologies.
  - Strong background in machine learning concepts.
  - Expertise in programming with Python, particularly for data science applications.
  - Familiarity with advanced topics such as neural networks, generative models, text mining, and reinforcement learning.

### 2. Teaching Skills:
- **Experience in Instruction**:
  - Proven ability to deliver dynamic and engaging lectures.
  - Experience facilitating interactive lab sessions and hands-on programming experience.
  - Capability to guide group collaboration and enhance student presentation skills.

## Necessary Computing Resources:
### 1. Hardware:
- **Student Equipment**:
  - All students are expected to bring laptops capable of running Python and data science libraries efficiently.
  - The classroom should be equipped with sufficient power outlets to support laptops during lab sessions.

### 2. Software:
- **Essential Software Requirements**:
  - Instructional materials should be compatible with Python environments.
  - Key recommended tools include:
    - Jupyter Notebooks (especially using Google Colab).
    - Data science libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
  - It is crucial to provide training for students on submission procedures for assignments via Canvas (acceptable formats: .pdf, .ipynb).

## Scheduling and Facility Limitations:
### 1. Classroom Availability:
- **Logistics**:
  - Course sessions are scheduled to last 75 minutes each.
  - The classroom must facilitate both lectures and lab work, requiring adequate seating and space for group work.

### 2. TA Support:
- **Teaching Assistance**:
  - One Teaching Assistant (TA) will be available for grading and guidance during office hours (Monday and Friday, 3:00 to 4:00 PM via Zoom).
  - The TA should be equipped to provide programming help, addressing students' technical questions during labs.
- **Effective Communication**:
  - Clear announcement of TA availability and support services should be made to students.

### 3. Integration of Course Elements:
- **Syllabus and Assessment**:
  - The syllabus must outline learning objectives, grading policies, and weekly schedules, emphasizing the structured group project (40% of the total grade).
  - Policies on accessibility and academic integrity should be clearly communicated in alignment with ASU institutional standards.

## Additional Considerations:
- **Background Preparation**:
  - Address potential skill gaps by offering preliminary resources or introductory materials in Python programming and data mining basics.
- **Communication**:
  - Establish channels for regular, clear communication regarding course policies, assignment submissions, and ethical standards.

By systematically addressing these key components, this assessment highlights the resources needed and constraints faced while delivering the "A1_4_Data_Mining" course. The outlined planning aspects should ensure an effective and enriching learning experience for students.
