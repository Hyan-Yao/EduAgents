Assessment & Evaluation Planning
================================

# Assessment and Evaluation Plan for A1_4_Data_Mining Course

## Overview
The assessment strategy emphasizes project-based evaluations, focusing on practical skills and real-world applications in data mining, replacing traditional exams with a cumulative final project.

## Learning Objectives Addressed
1. Application of core techniques in data mining.
2. Model evaluation and selection based on performance metrics.
3. Proficiency in data preprocessing.
4. Implementation of algorithms using Python.
5. Exploration of advanced data mining topics.
6. Collaboration and presentation skills through group projects.
7. Awareness and adherence to ethical standards in data mining.

## Assessment Components

### 1. Assignments (30% of Total Grade)
- **Format**: Weekly programming assignments submitted via Canvas in `.ipynb` and `.pdf` formats.
- **Content**: 
  - Data exploration and preprocessing techniques.
  - Implementation of classification algorithms.
  - Evaluation of model performance.
- **Timing**: Due weekly at the end of each week (Fridays).

### 2. Group Project (40% of Total Grade)
- **Description**: Collaborative project involving the design, implementation, evaluation, and presentation of a data mining solution on a real-world dataset.
- **Milestones**:
  1. **Project Proposal (10%)**
     - **Format**: Written proposal (.pdf) detailing the dataset, problem statement, and approach.
     - **Due**: End of Week 5.
   
  2. **Progress Report (10%)**
