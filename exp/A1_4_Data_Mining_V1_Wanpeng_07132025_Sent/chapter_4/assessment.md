  A) They are never accurate
  B) They are simple to interpret
  C) They should always be used
  D) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** One of the key takeaways is that decision trees are known for their simplicity and ease of interpretation.

**Question 2:** Which component of a decision tree represents the final outcome?

  A) Nodes
  B) Branches
  C) Leaves
  D) Roots

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Leaves are the terminal nodes that represent final outcomes or classifications in a decision tree.

**Question 3:** What is one limitation of decision trees mentioned in this chapter?

  A) They require extensive training data
  B) They are susceptible to overfitting
  C) They are only usable with numerical data
  D) They do not handle missing values

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Decision trees can become overly complex and fitting to noise in the data, which is known as overfitting.

**Question 4:** What advantage do decision trees have regarding data distribution?

  A) They require normally distributed data
  B) They assume a linear relationship between variables
  C) They make no assumptions about the data distribution
  D) They can only model categorical variables

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Decision trees can handle data without making assumptions about its distribution, allowing for greater flexibility.
