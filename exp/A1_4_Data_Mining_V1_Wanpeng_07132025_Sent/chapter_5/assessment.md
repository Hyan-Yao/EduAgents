  B) They are always easier to interpret.
  C) They generally provide better accuracy and generalization.
  D) They cannot handle large datasets.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Ensemble methods, including Random Forests, typically outperform single models in terms of accuracy and generalization due to their ability to combine various models’ strengths.

### Activities
- Develop a mini-project to apply Random Forests on a publicly available dataset. Analyze the feature importance and interpret the results.
- Create a comparative analysis chart of Random Forests and another ensemble technique, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each.

### Discussion Questions
- In what contexts have you seen Random Forests being effectively applied?
- How does the randomness in Random Forests influence the outcome compared to more deterministic models?
- Can you think of scenarios where Random Forests might not be the best choice compared to other machine learning techniques?
