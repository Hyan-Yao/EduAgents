    \frametitle{Introduction to Reinforcement Learning - What is RL?}
    
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled data, RL focuses on exploring the consequences of actions and learning from them through trial and error.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Key Focus: Learning through interaction and experience
        \item Contrast with supervised learning: No labeled data
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Components of Reinforcement Learning}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item **Agent**: The learner or decision maker.

        \item **Actions (A)**: Choices the agent can make at any given state.
        \item **States (S)**: Different situations or configurations of the environment.
        \item **Rewards (R)**: Feedback received after taking an action; positive or negative.
        \item **Policy (π)**: A strategy that defines the agent’s behavior; can be deterministic or stochastic.

    \frametitle{Core Components of Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Key Concepts}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Agent}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Definition: The learner or decision-maker that interacts with the environment to achieve a goal.
                    \item Example: In a game of chess, the player (AI or human) is the agent making strategic moves.
                \end{itemize}

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Definition: Everything the agent interacts with; it encompasses the conditions and responses that affect the agent's actions.
                    \item Example: In a robotics scenario, the physical world where the robot operates represents the environment.
                \end{itemize}

            \item \textbf{State}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Definition: A specific situation or configuration of the environment at a given time.
                    \item Example: In a game, the arrangement of the pieces on the board at any point is a state.
                \end{itemize}

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Definition: The choices available to the agent at any state that can alter the state of the environment.
                    \item Example: In chess, moving a piece from one square to another is an action.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reward}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Definition: A feedback signal received after each action taken by the agent, indicating the success or failure of that action.
                    \item Example: In a video game, scoring points for defeating an enemy represents a reward.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points and Concluding Remarks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Interaction Loop}: The agent interacts with the environment by taking actions, observing states, and receiving rewards in a continuous loop.
        \item \textbf{Learning Objective}: The goal of the agent is to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Model-free RL is preferred for many applications but may require excessive data.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Exploration vs. Exploitation}
    
    \begin{block}{Understanding the Duality}
        In reinforcement learning, agents face a fundamental trade-off between two strategies:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Exploration}: Trying new actions to discover their potential rewards.
            \item \textbf{Exploitation}: Choosing known actions that yield high rewards to maximize current returns.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Example of exploration: A robot moving randomly in a new area.
        \item Example of exploitation: A robot choosing a path it knows leads to food.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Importance of Balancing Exploration and Exploitation}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Potential vs. Reward:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Too much exploration can lead to missed opportunities.
            \item Too much exploitation can prevent discovering better strategies.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Example:} A child with a toy box.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Playing only with their favorite toy (exploitation) might overlook other enjoyable toys (exploration).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Strategies to Balance Exploration and Exploitation}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Epsilon-Greedy Method}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item With probability $\epsilon$, choose a random action (explore).
            \item With probability $(1 - \epsilon)$, choose the best-known action (exploit).
            \item Adjust $\epsilon$ over time (e.g., start high and decrease).
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Choose actions based on potential rewards and their uncertainty.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Softmax Action Selection}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Actions are selected based on a probability distribution favoring higher reward actions.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Remember}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Agents must manage the trade-off.
            \item Dynamic adjustment of exploration leads to improved learning.
            \item Applications range across recommendation systems and robotics.

        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Credit Assignment Problem}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        The credit assignment problem involves determining which actions taken in the past are responsible for current rewards.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Imagine a robot learning to navigate a maze. If it reaches the goal after several moves, which specific actions contributed to its success?
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Impact}
        This problem complicates the learning process; the agent may struggle to reinforce beneficial behaviors if the effect of its actions is not immediately observable.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Environments with Delayed Rewards}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        In many real-world scenarios, rewards may not be received until much later after an action has been taken.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In financial trading, a decision to buy a stock may only yield positive results days or weeks later.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Impact}
        Delayed rewards can lead to inefficient learning as agents may update their knowledge based on outdated information, making it harder to learn optimal policies.
    \end{block}
