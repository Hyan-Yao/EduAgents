        \item \textbf{Key Points to Emphasize:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Nature of Change: Feature selection keeps original features intact, while dimensionality reduction creates new ones.
                \item Use Cases: Feature selection is crucial for interpretability; dimensionality reduction excels in complex data.
                \item Complementary Use: These techniques can be used together for optimal results.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Further Reading:} Explore various algorithms and their implementations (Python examples) for both techniques using libraries like \texttt{sklearn.feature_selection} and \texttt{sklearn.decomposition}.
    \end{itemize}
