    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{What is Model Development?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The process of selecting a machine learning algorithm and training it to make predictions or classifications.
            \item Key steps include:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Data Preparation}: Cleansing, transforming, and splitting data into training and test sets.
                \item \textbf{Model Selection}: Choosing the appropriate algorithm based on problem type (classification, regression).
                \item \textbf{Training the Model}: Teaching the model to recognize patterns using training data.
                \item \textbf{Hyperparameter Tuning}: Optimizing parameters to enhance performance.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
