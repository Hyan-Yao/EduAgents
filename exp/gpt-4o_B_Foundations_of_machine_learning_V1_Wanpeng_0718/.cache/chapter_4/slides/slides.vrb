\frametitle{Key Concepts: Scatter Plots}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A scatter plot visually represents pairs of values from two variables.
        \item Example: Hours studied (X-axis) vs. exam scores (Y-axis).
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Scatter Plot Interpretation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Positive Relationship: One variable increases as the other does (e.g., hours studied ↔ exam scores).
            \item Negative Relationship: One variable increases as the other decreases (e.g., time spent on social media ↔ exam scores).
            \item No Relationship: Random distribution suggests no clear relationship.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
