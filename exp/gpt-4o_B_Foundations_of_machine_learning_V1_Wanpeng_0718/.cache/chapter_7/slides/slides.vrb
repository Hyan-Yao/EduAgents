\frametitle{Limitations of SVM - Sensitivity to Noise}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Impact of Outliers:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item SVMs are sensitive to noise and outliers in the training data.
            \item Outliers can significantly affect the decision boundary, leading to poorer generalization.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Soft Margin SVMs:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can handle some noise via soft margins, but too many misclassifications can degrade performance.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Illustration:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Points:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Class 1: ● ● ● ● ● ●
                \item Class 2: ○ ○ ○ ○ ● (red circle - outlier)
            \end{itemize}
            \item Decision boundary changes significantly due to the presence of outliers.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        The regularization parameter \(C\) in SVMs can control the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification error.
