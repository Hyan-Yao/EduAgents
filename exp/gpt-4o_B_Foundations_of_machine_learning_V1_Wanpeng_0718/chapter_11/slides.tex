    \begin{block}{Introduction to Data Privacy in Machine Learning}
        Data privacy refers to the proper handling, processing, and storage of personal information. 
        In the context of machine learning (ML), where massive amounts of data are collected and 
        analyzed, privacy concerns have become paramount. Understanding these concerns is crucial for ethical ML practices.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Data Privacy Concerns - Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data Collection}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Gathering data from various sources, including user behavior, preferences, and demographics. 
            \item \textit{Example}: Social media platforms collect user data to personalize feeds, often without explicit consent.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{User Consent}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Obtaining permission from users to collect and use their data. 
            \item Ethical implications arise when consent is ambiguous or obtained through misleading practices.
            \item \textit{Example}: "I agree" checkboxes that ignore user understanding and lack options for opting out.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{User Autonomy}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Users' ability to control their own data and make informed decisions about its usage.
            \item Ethical ML practices should empower users with transparency on data usage and easy avenues to withdraw consent.
