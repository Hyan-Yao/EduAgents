  B) Syntax is identical
  C) Optimized performance and ease of use
  D) DataFrames do not support SQL

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** DataFrames provide a higher-level API that is optimized for performance and resembles SQL tables, making them easier to use than RDDs.

### Activities
- Create a DataFrame from a sample dataset and perform a SQL query to extract specific information.
- Implement a simple logistic regression model using MLlib with a provided dataset to predict an outcome.

### Discussion Questions
- How can the use of caching and persistence in Spark affect performance? Provide an example.
- In what scenarios would you prefer using DataFrames over RDDs for data processing?
