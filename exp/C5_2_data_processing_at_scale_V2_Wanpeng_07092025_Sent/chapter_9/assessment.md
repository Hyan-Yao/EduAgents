**Explanation:** Cypher is the query language specifically designed for Neo4j to facilitate easy interaction with graph data.

**Question 3:** Which algorithm evaluates the importance of nodes within a graph?

  A) Dijkstra's
  B) A* Search
  C) PageRank
  D) Floyd-Warshall

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** PageRank is an algorithm that ranks nodes based on the importance derived from their connections to other nodes.

**Question 4:** Which of the following is NOT a typical use case for Neo4j?

  A) Fraud detection
  B) Data warehousing
  C) Recommendation systems
  D) Knowledge graphs

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Neo4j is not typically suited for data warehousing, which is better handled by traditional relational databases.

### Activities
- Group Activity: Break into small groups and discuss potential use cases for Neo4j in your respective fields. Prepare a brief presentation to share with the class.
- Hands-on Exercise: Write a Cypher query to find all transactions made by a user named 'Bob' in a fictional e-commerce dataset.

### Discussion Questions
- What potential applications do you foresee for Neo4j in your projects?
- What challenges might you anticipate while working with graph databases?
- Are there specific graph algorithms or Cypher queries you want to explore further?
