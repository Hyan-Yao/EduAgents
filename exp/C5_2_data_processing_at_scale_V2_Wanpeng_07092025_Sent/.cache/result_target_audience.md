### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Pre-Course Assessments:**
   - Implement student surveys to identify specific knowledge gaps and tailor resources accordingly.

2. **Introductory Workshops:**
   - Organize preparatory workshops on distributed systems, cloud computing, and essential tools (Hadoop, Spark, AWS, Docker).

3. **Paced Instruction with Support Materials:**
   - Ensure a gradual release of complex material; provide supplementary tutorials or reading guides.

4. **Emphasize Collaborative Learning:**
   - Design team projects that utilize the range of student backgrounds for enhanced learning outcomes.

5. **Continuous Feedback Loop:**
   - Establish ongoing student feedback mechanisms to adapt pacing and content dynamically.

6. **Resource Availability:**
   - Provide early access to necessary tools, platforms, and software, minimizing initial barriers to participation.

7. **Foundational Workshops:**
   - Extend workshops to include principles of distributed systems and cloud architectures, incorporating alumni or industry insights.

8. **Supplemental Resources:**
   - Create a resource hub with tutorials, readings, and exercises guided by student self-assessments.

9. **Incremental Skill Development:**
   - Scaffold projects in complexity, ensuring early assignments reinforce foundational knowledge.

10. **Mathematical Foundations Support:**
    - Offer optional mini-courses or resources focused on discrete mathematics and optimization techniques.

11. **Pacing and Feedback:**
    - Introduce regular understanding checkpoints within each session coupled with anonymous feedback tools.

12. **Hybrid Learning Adaptations:**
    - Ensure equality of access and interaction for both in-person and remote students through collaborative tools.

13. **Capstone Projects:**
    - Structure the course towards a capstone project that integrates all learned skills and includes industry collaboration opportunities.

14. **Real-Time Adjustments:**
    - Implement mid-course evaluations for continuous instructional strategy adjustments.

15. **Alumni Feedback and Instructor Workshops:**
    - Use alumni insights for course content refinement; conduct faculty workshops to address common student difficulties identified in evaluations.
