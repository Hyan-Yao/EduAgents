# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: C5_2_data_processing_at_scale

## Faculty Expertise Requirements
1. **Technical Knowledge**: 
   - Faculty should possess expertise in:
     - Various data models: relational, NoSQL, and graph databases, with clear explanations of use cases and limitations.
     - Distributed data processing frameworks, namely Hadoop and Spark, coupled with hands-on experience for effective instruction and troubleshooting within the course.
     - Cloud service platforms, especially AWS, and container orchestration with Kubernetes for deploying distributed systems.
     - Database design and optimization fundamentals along with data infrastructure management principles.
     - Proficient knowledge of key industry tools to support practical project work and reinforce operational competencies in data processing.

2. **Teaching Skills**: 
   - Ability to deliver complex technical content engagingly and understandably.
   - Experience in leading teamwork-based projects while promoting student collaboration.
   - Capable of providing timely and constructive feedback on complex assignments to facilitate student learning.

3. **Technical Support Availability**: 
   - Faculty must be accessible to address technical issues concerning distributed systems, GitHub, and other software tools utilized in the course.

## Necessary Computing Resources
1. **Hardware**: 
   - Classrooms and labs should be well-equipped with high-performance computers capable of handling large datasets, essential for practical applications involving distributed systems.

2. **Cloud Infrastructure**: 
   - Adequate budget should be allocated for utilizing cloud platforms (e.g., AWS) to give students access to necessary environments for cloud database deployments and management tasks.

3. **Version Control Systems**: 
   - Students need robust access to GitHub for project management, including private repositories for group assignments to foster collaboration.

4. **Software Tool Installation**: 
   - Ensure all relevant software installations (Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL databases) are preconfigured and accessible to students prior to coursework commencement.

## Software Requirements
1. **LMS Compliance**: 
   - All instructional materials and submissions must be hosted on Canvas, necessitating faculty training in its functionalities to adhere to ASU's academic integrity and accessibility policies.

2. **Accessibility Considerations**: 
   - All content must comply with accessibility standards, ensuring it is presented in formats accessible to all students, including support for those needing accommodations.

3. **Clear Submission Guidelines**: 
   - Protocols and instructions for assignment submissions must be clear, specifying formats (PDF, GitHub links) to streamline grading processes.

## Scheduling Constraints
1. **Fixed Session Duration**: 
   - The 75-minute session format demands meticulous planning to optimize the coverage of complex topics and ensure adequate time for both instruction and hands-on exercises.

2. **Hybrid Learning Format**: 
   - Technology infrastructure must support both in-person and remote students, introducing complexities in scheduling classroom layout and equipment setup.

3. **TA Availability**: 
   - Scheduling must align TA support with course demands, ensuring that they are available to manage office hours and provide timely feedback and assistance during projects.

## Facility Limitations
1. **Classroom Equipment**: 
   - Classrooms must be technologically equipped with projectors, good sound systems, and reliable Wi-Fi to create a conducive learning environment for diverse delivery formats.

2. **Space Management**: 
   - Sufficient classroom capacity must be organized to accommodate hybrid classes, supporting optimal interaction between students participating in various formats.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
1. **Faculty Development Workshops**: 
   - Initiate workshops focused on emerging technologies in cloud computing and data processing to keep faculty updated.

2. **Resource Allocation Planning**: 
   - Establish a comprehensive budget plan early, ensuring budgets for cloud services, hardware, and software are identified and ready prior to the course starting date.

3. **Technology Testing**: 
   - Conduct pre-course tests of all technological infrastructure to troubleshoot potential issues while gathering usability feedback from faculty, TAs, and students.

4. **Ongoing Evaluation Mechanisms**: 
   - Implement regular checkpoints throughout the course to collect student feedback on pace and clarity of instruction, adjusting course delivery to align with educational outcomes effectively.
