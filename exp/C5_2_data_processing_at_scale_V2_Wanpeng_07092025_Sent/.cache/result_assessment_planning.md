## Submission Logistics

- **Formats**:
  - Quizzes and Exams: Completed on Canvas.
  - Assignments: Submitted as `.ipynb` via Canvas or GitHub links.
  - Group Project: Final reports as .pdf; project code linked on GitHub.

- **Late Submission Policy**: Late submissions incur a penalty of 10% per day unless otherwise arranged.

---

## Emphasis on Real-World Applications

All assessments will focus on applying learned concepts in real-world scenarios, enhancing technical and soft skills through collaboration and peer evaluation.

---

## Recommendations for Enhancement

- **Detailed Grading Rubrics**: Integrate explicit points for each criterion.
- **Expectation Setting**: Provide examples of thorough and engaging contributions for discussion.
- **Individual Contributions**: Include individual reflective components in group projects.
- **Diverse Assessment Formats**: Consider alternative submissions such as infographics and videos.
- **Case Study Analyses**: Include individual assessments on specific case studies.
- **Industry Guest Feedback**: Facilitate expert evaluations during project presentations.
- **Iterative Learning**: Allow feedback after initial project presentations.
- **Grace Period for Late Submissions**: Implement a “no-penalty” late submission approach.
- **Accessibility Standards**: Ensure assessments are universally accessible in multiple formats.
- **Mid-Semester Feedback**: Introduce a feedback mechanism to adjust course delivery.
