**Question 3:** What challenge is associated with maintaining data consistency in distributed databases?

  A) Network Latency
  B) Data Fragmentation
  C) Protocols such as Two-Phase Commit
  D) Scalability

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Protocols like Two-Phase Commit are essential in distributed systems to maintain data consistency across multiple sites, which can be complex.

**Question 4:** What is an advantage of using a replicated model in distributed databases?

  A) Increased data inconsistency
  B) Ability to run independently without communication
  C) Improved availability and reliability of data
  D) Reduction in network load

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The replicated model enhances the availability and reliability of data by copying it across multiple sites, thus ensuring that data is accessible even if one site fails.
