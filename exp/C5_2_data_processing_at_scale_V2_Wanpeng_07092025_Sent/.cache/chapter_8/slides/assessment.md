**Question 2:** Which of the following is NOT a type of NoSQL database?

  A) Document Store
  B) Graph Database
  C) Relational Database
  D) Key-Value Store

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Relational Database is not a type of NoSQL database; it is the opposite of NoSQL and based on a fixed schema.

**Question 3:** In MongoDB, what is the primary unit of data storage?

  A) Table
  B) Document
  C) Row
  D) Column

**Correct Answer:** B

  C) Redis
  D) Couchbase

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Cassandra uses Cassandra Query Language (CQL) for querying data, which is similar to SQL but designed for Cassandra's architecture.

**Question 5:** What is a common use case for Cassandra due to its architectural design?

  A) Content management systems
  B) Graph processing
  C) IoT applications and real-time analytics
  D) Simple web applications

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Cassandra is designed to handle high volumes of writes and offers high availability, making it suitable for IoT applications and real-time analytics.
