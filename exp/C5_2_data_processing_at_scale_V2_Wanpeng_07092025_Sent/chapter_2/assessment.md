**Explanation:** Understanding the intricacies of query processing is crucial for improving data retrieval and performance.

**Question 2:** Which optimization technique evaluates multiple execution plans based on estimated resource usage?

  A) Rule-Based Optimization (RBO)
  B) Cost-Based Optimization (CBO)
  C) Direct Execution Plan
  D) Query Syntax Analysis

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Cost-Based Optimization (CBO) examines the estimated resource usage to select the most efficient query execution plan.

**Question 3:** What is the effect of poorly optimized queries on database performance?

  A) They have no impact on performance.
  B) They can lead to performance bottlenecks.
  C) They always improve performance.
  D) They only affect small databases.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Poorly optimized queries can significantly affect performance, especially in large databases, leading to slower response times and increased resource consumption.

**Question 4:** What is a potential practical project to apply the concepts learned in this chapter?

  A) Writing a book on database theory.
  B) Creating and optimizing queries in a mock database.
  C) Reading about cloud computing.
  D) Attending seminars on data privacy.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Creating and optimizing queries in a mock database provides hands-on experience with query processing and optimization.
