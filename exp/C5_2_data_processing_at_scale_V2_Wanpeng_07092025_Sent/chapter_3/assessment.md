## Section 16: Conclusion and Questions

### Learning Objectives
- Summarize the key points discussed throughout the course.
- Encourage continued learning and inquiry beyond course completion.
- Identify and explain key characteristics and challenges of distributed systems.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is a key characteristic of distributed systems that allows them to continue functioning despite individual component failures?

  A) Scalability
  B) Fault Tolerance
  C) Concurrency
  D) Synchronization

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Fault tolerance is essential in distributed systems as it ensures the system can continue operating even when some of its components fail.

**Question 2:** Which type of distributed system allows each participant to act as both a client and a server?

  A) Client-Server Model
  B) Cloud Computing
  C) Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
  D) Distributed Database

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model enables each node to act both as a client and a server, facilitating direct resource sharing.

**Question 3:** What is a primary challenge in distributed systems concerning data integrity?

  A) High Availability
  B) Network Latency
  C) Data Consistency
  D) Load Balancing

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Data consistency is a major challenge as it involves maintaining the same data across all nodes despite concurrent modifications.

**Question 4:** In the context of distributed systems, what does scalability refer to?

  A) The ability to recover from failures
  B) The capability to expand and manage increased load
  C) The reduction of response time
  D) The coordination of multiple processes

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Scalability refers to a distributed system’s capability to grow and manage increased load seamlessly.
