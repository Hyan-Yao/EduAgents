# Final Project Plan Document

## Project Overview
### Project Title: 
Scaling Up: Building a Distributed Database for Real-World Applications

### Description:
The final project involves the design, implementation, and management of a scalable distributed database solution that addresses a real-world problem using cloud technologies. Students will work collaboratively in teams to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios, enhancing their skills in data processing at scale.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a working knowledge of distributed database systems.
2. Enhance collaboration and communication skills within teams.
3. Apply theoretical concepts to solve real-world data challenges.
4. Foster critical thinking through the analysis of team dynamics and technical implementation.

## Submission Formats & Logistics
- All project proposals and progress presentations will be submitted via Canvas.
- Final reports must be submitted as PDFs and include links to GitHub repositories.
- GitHub repositories should be well-documented for grading purposes.

## Academic Integrity Guidelines
- All submissions must reflect original work; plagiarism will be addressed according to university policies.
- Collaboration is encouraged, but accountability will be assessed through peer reviews.
- Use of GitHub for version control and code submission is mandatory.

## Feedback Mechanisms
- Peer feedback sessions will occur after each milestone to enhance project quality and understanding.
- Instructors will provide feedback at each milestone on both technical and collaborative aspects.

## Final Notes
This project will equip students with practical skills in distributed data solutions and prepare them for real-world applications of data processing at scale while fostering teamwork and critical thinking.
