    \begin{block}{Introduction to Technologies in Data Projects}
        In today's data-driven world, leveraging the right technology is crucial for efficiently managing, processing, and analyzing data. 
        This slide highlights key technologies used in your projects: 
        \textbf{Hadoop}, \textbf{Spark}, \textbf{SQL}, and \textbf{Visualization Tools}.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Hadoop}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Hadoop is an open-source framework that allows for the distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System):} A scalable file storage system that breaks down large files into smaller blocks and distributes them across the cluster.
        \item \textbf{MapReduce:} A programming model for processing large data sets with a distributed algorithm.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example Use Case}
        Imagine you have terabytes of sales data. With Hadoop, you can store this data in HDFS and process it using MapReduce to calculate total sales by region.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{2. Spark}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning, and graph processing.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{In-Memory Processing:} Unlike Hadoop, Spark processes data in memory, which significantly speeds up data processing tasks.
        \item \textbf{Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs):} A fundamental data structure of Spark that enables parallel processing.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example Use Case}
        For real-time analytics, you could use Spark Streaming to process live data from social media feeds to determine sentiment around a marketing campaign.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{3. SQL and 4. Visualization Tools}
    \begin{block}{SQL (Structured Query Language)}
        SQL is a standardized language for managing and manipulating relational databases.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Queries:} Use SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and join data from tables.
        \item \textbf{Data Manipulation:} SQL supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example Use Case}
        You can use SQL to query your database for customer information with a simple statement:
        \begin{lstlisting}
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'USA';
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Visualization Tools}
        Visualization tools help to create visual representations of data, making it easier to understand and draw insights from complex datasets.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Common Tools:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Tableau: A powerful data visualization software that helps create interactive dashboards.
                \item Power BI: A Microsoft product for transforming raw data into informative visuals.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example Use Case}
        You may have used Tableau to create a dashboard that visualizes sales trends over the past year, allowing stakeholders to see performance metrics at a glance.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}
