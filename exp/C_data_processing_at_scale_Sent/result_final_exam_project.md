# Final Project Plan: Developing an End-to-End Data Processing Pipeline

## Description
This project allows students to design, implement, and present a data processing pipeline that addresses a real-world business problem using technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, SQL, and data visualization tools. The project promotes analytical thinking, technical skills, and collaboration through practical application of course concepts.

## Objectives
- Design a scalable data processing pipeline.
- Utilize relevant technologies effectively (Hadoop, Spark, SQL).
- Analyze real-world data to extract insights.
- Enhance technical programming skills and data visualization abilities.
- Foster teamwork and collaborative problem-solving.
