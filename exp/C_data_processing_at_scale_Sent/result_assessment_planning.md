Assessment & Evaluation Planning
================================

# Assessment and Evaluation Plan for "Data Processing at Scale"

## Overall Structure
The evaluation strategy emphasizes project-based assessments to ensure a practical connection to real-world data processing challenges while fostering analytical thinking and collaboration. Traditional exams are replaced with milestones that collectively form a final project. All submissions will be made via the Canvas LMS, primarily in formats of .pdf for reports and .ipynb files for coding assignments, ensuring versatility and accessibility.

## Assessment Components

### 1. Participation and Engagement (10% of total grade)
- **Format**: Observational and peer feedback
- **Details**: Active participation in discussions, labs, and project updates.
- **Evaluation**: Instructors will assess engagement based on attendance and the quality of contributions to discussions and group work using a checklist/rubric for consistency.

### 2. Assignments (30% of total grade)
- **Frequency**: 6 assignments distributed throughout the semester (approximately every 2 weeks).
- **Types**:
  - **Report** (.pdf): Brief assessments on specific concepts (e.g., ETL process mapping, data analysis).
  - **Practical Lab Work** (.ipynb): Hands-on coding assignments involving data processing with Hadoop/Spark or SQL queries.
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Clarity and organization: 25%
  - Technical accuracy: 50%
  - Insightful application of concepts: 25%
- **Submission Logistics**: Collected through Canvas, due by 11:59 PM on the assigned due date.

### 3. Quizzes (15% of total grade)
- **Frequency**: 4 quizzes, each related to recent content (Weeks 6, 8, 9, and 12).
- **Format**: Hybrid of open-ended questions (descriptive explanations) and multiple-choice questions (key terms and definitions).
- **Timing**: Quizzes to take place at the beginning or end of class where applicable, each around 30 minutes in length.

### 4. Milestone-Driven Team Project (30% of total grade)
- **Project Overview**: Teams propose, design, and implement a data processing pipeline for a specified business case.
- **Milestones**:
  - **Week 10**: **Project Proposal (5%)**: 2-page written outline detailing objectives, technology stack, and initial design (.pdf submission).
  - **Week 11**: **Progress Report (10%)**: Detailed update including challenges faced, solutions sought, and next steps (.pdf submission).
  - **Week 12**: **Final Project Implementation (15%)**: Final project submission (.ipynb for coding part, .pdf for the report) and team presentation to the class.
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Proposal/Report quality: 30%
  - Implementation functionality and optimization: 40%
  - Presentation quality and teamwork: 30%

### 5. Final Comprehensive Team Project (15% of total grade)
- **Cumulative Project**: Finalize projects based on feedback from mid-course milestones.
- **Details**: Submission includes integrated code, final report summarizing the project, and lessons learned (.ipynb and .pdf).
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Completeness and thoroughness: 35%
  - Real-world applicability and innovation: 35%
  - Reflection and critical analysis of data processing techniques: 30%

## Timeline Overview
- **Assignments (every 2 weeks)**: weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.
- **Quizzes**: scheduled at the start of weeks 6, 8, 9, and 12.
- **Project Proposal**: due week 10.
- **Progress Report**: due week 11.
- **Final Project and Presentation**: during week 12.

## Grading Policies
- **Grades** will follow a standard scale:
  - A: 90-100
  - B: 80-89
  - C: 70-79
  - D: 60-69
  - F: Below 60
- **Late submissions** will incur a penalty of 5% per day unless arrangements are made in advance.
- **Academic dishonesty** policies will be strictly enforced.
