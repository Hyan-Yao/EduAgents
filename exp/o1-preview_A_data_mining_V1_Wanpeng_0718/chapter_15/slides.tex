    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Misreading Questions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation:} Students often skim questions and misunderstand key terms or requirements (e.g., "compare" vs. "contrast").
            \item \textbf{Example:} A question asks to "list" advantages, but students elaborate on them instead.
            \item \textbf{Avoidance Strategy:} Take your time to read each question carefully, underline key words, and ensure you understand what is being asked.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation:} Running out of time can lead to incomplete answers or guesswork.
            \item \textbf{Example:} Spending too long on questions that are challenging, leaving insufficient time for easier questions later.
            \item \textbf{Avoidance Strategy:} Allocate time for each section of the exam. Use a watch or the timer on your phone to monitor your progress.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Failing to Review Answers:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation:} Many students neglect to review their answers, leading to missed errors or incomplete responses.
            \item \textbf{Example:} A student answers a multiple-choice question but accidentally selects the wrong option due to misalignment in their choice.

            \item \textbf{Example:} A true/false question may be simple, but the student overanalyzes it before changing their initial correct answer.
            \item \textbf{Avoidance Strategy:} Trust your instincts. If you feel strongly about a choice, it's usually right unless you find clear evidence to the contrary.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Ignoring Instructions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation:} Not adhering to guidelines can lead to lost points.
            \item \textbf{Example:} A question that requires you to answer in a specific format (e.g., essay vs. bullet points).
