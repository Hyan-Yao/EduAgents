## Course Description
This course introduces students to the foundational concepts, methods, and applications of data mining. Students will learn various techniques for extracting meaningful insights from large data sets, including data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and results interpretation. Emphasis will be placed on practical applications, ethical considerations, and real-world case studies.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Define key terminology and concepts in data mining.
2. Implement various data mining algorithms using R or Python.
3. Conduct data cleaning, transformation, and normalization processes.
4. Analyze and interpret data mining results and communicate findings effectively.
5. Discuss ethical implications related to data mining practices.
6. Solve real-world problems using data mining techniques through collaborative projects.
7. Critically evaluate different data mining methodologies.
8. Work collaboratively in teams and communicate effectively.
