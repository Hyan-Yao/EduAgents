Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

### Learning Objectives for Data Mining Course

1. **Foundational Knowledge of Data Mining Concepts:**
   - Identify and define key terminology in data mining, including concepts such as data preprocessing, data mining processes, and major algorithms (e.g., classification, regression, clustering, association rule mining).

2. **Practical Application of Data Mining Techniques:**
   - Demonstrate the ability to select and implement at least three different data mining algorithms using specified software tools (e.g., R, Python, or Weka) to analyze provided data sets.

3. **Data Preparation and Cleaning:**
   - Conduct data cleaning, transformation, and normalization on a data set, explaining the rationale for each preprocessing step taken.

4. **Interpretation of Data Mining Results:**
   - Analyze and interpret the output of data mining processes, creating a report that effectively communicates findings tailored for both technical and non-technical audiences.

5. **Ethics and Privacy in Data Mining:**
   - Discuss the ethical implications of data mining practices, providing examples that address concerns related to data ownership, consent, and the ethical use of data.

6. **Real-World Problem-Solving:**
   - Engage in a case study project that applies data mining techniques to solve a real-world problem, presenting the solution and methodology to peers.

7. **Critical Thinking and Analytical Skills:**
   - Evaluate different data mining methodologies through a critical analysis report that discusses strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate application contexts for each method.

8. **Collaboration and Communication:**
   - Work in teams to collaborate on a project, demonstrating effective communication skills during group presentations and interactions, while clearly articulating complex data-driven insights.
