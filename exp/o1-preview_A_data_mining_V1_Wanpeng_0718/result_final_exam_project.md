# Final Project Plan: Real-World Data Mining Case Study

## Description
The final project in this Data Mining course replaces the traditional exam and provides an opportunity to apply data mining techniques to real-world problems. Working in collaborative groups, students will analyze a dataset, employ various algorithms, and present their findings, fostering critical thinking and ethical considerations in data mining.

## Objectives
1. Apply data mining algorithms to analyze a real-world dataset.
2. Develop critical thinking and analytical skills through data interpretation and reporting.
3. Promote teamwork and collaboration among peers.
4. Engage with ethical implications in data mining practices.
5. Enhance presentation skills through effective communication of analysis.
