\frametitle{Introduction to Regression Analysis - Example}
    \begin{block}{Example Scenario}
        Imagine you are a marketer trying to forecast sales based on advertising spending.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Dependent Variable (Y):} Sales (in dollars).
            \item \textbf{Independent Variable (X):} Advertising Spending (in dollars).
        \end{itemize}

        Regression Analysis would provide you with:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A line of best fit through your data points.
            \item A formula that might look like \(Y = 200 + 5X\), implying for every dollar spent on advertising, sales increase by $5.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
