\frametitle{Conclusion & Recap}
    Evaluating association rules using support, confidence, and lift aids in identifying rules that are frequent, reliable, and informative.

    \textbf{Quick Recap:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Support:} Frequency of a rule
        \item \textbf{Confidence:} Reliability of the implication from A to B
        \item \textbf{Lift:} Strength of the association compared to the base rate
    \end{itemize}

    Mastering these concepts enables effective use of association rule mining to uncover meaningful patterns in data.
