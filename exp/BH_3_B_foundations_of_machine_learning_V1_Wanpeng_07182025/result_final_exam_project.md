Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan for "Foundations of Machine Learning" Course

## Project Overview
The final project is a group-based assignment where students will collaboratively identify a real-world data-driven problem, develop machine learning models, and evaluate the outcomes, integrating ethical considerations throughout the work.

## Objectives
- Identify and articulate a real-world data-driven problem.
- Develop and implement machine learning models.
- Analyze and interpret the results of the models.
- Address ethical considerations relevant to the project.
- Enhance teamwork skills and individual contributions through collaboration.

## Timeline with Milestones
