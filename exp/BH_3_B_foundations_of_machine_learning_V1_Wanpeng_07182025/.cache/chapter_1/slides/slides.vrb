    \begin{block}{Cumulative Reward}
        \begin{equation}
            R_t = r_1 + \gamma r_2 + \gamma^2 r_3 + \ldots + \gamma^{T-t} r_T
        \end{equation}
        Where \( r_i \) is the reward received at time step \( i \) and \( \gamma \) (0 â‰¤ \( \gamma \) < 1) is the discount factor prioritizing immediate rewards over distant rewards.
