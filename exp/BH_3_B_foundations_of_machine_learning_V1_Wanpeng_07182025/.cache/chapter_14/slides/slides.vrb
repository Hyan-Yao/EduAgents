    \begin{block}{Example Case Study: Successful Group Project}
        Suppose a team is tasked with creating a marketing strategy for a new product. They can apply the discussed concepts as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Role Assignment}: One member leads research, another focuses on budgeting, while a third designs the presentation.
            \item \textbf{Check-ins}: Weekly meetings to review progress and adjust the strategy based on data.
            \item \textbf{Feedback}: Each member shares ideas and constructive criticism, enhancing the final proposal.
        \end{itemize}
        Through this process, they enhance both their learning and collaborative effectiveness.
