\frametitle{Examples to Facilitate Discussion}
    To enhance our discussion, consider the following examples:

    \begin{block}{Example 1}
        Data analyzing the impact of study time on exam scores using linear regression shows a relationship. What if adding "previous exam performance" significantly changes your results?
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example 2}
        A model predicting house prices based on size could overlook significant factors like neighborhood features (e.g., crime rate, proximity to schools). How might this oversight impact accuracy and ethics?
    \end{block}
