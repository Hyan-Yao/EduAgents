Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

1. Students will articulate fundamental concepts and terminology of machine learning, including key principles such as supervised vs. unsupervised learning, overfitting, and model evaluation metrics.

2. Students will implement specific supervised (e.g., linear regression, decision trees) and unsupervised (e.g., k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering) learning algorithms using programming tools (e.g., Python) and libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn).

3. Students will demonstrate proficiency in data preprocessing techniques, including normalization, transformation, and handling missing values, achieving at least 80% accuracy in applied real-world datasets.

4. Students will construct machine learning models and utilize performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model effectiveness and accuracy.

5. Students will critically analyze case studies of machine learning applications, discussing ethical considerations and proposing actions to mitigate identified ethical issues and societal impacts.

6. Students will collaborate effectively on group projects, presenting their findings clearly and concisely, supported by a rubric for evaluating both individual contributions and overall group dynamics.
