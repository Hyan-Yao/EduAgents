- Choose a real-world dataset suitable for logistic regression and perform a logistic regression analysis using a statistical software tool or Python. Document your findings and interpret the coefficients of the model.

### Discussion Questions
- Discuss a scenario where logistic regression would be a suitable model. What factors would you consider before implementing it?
- What are the ethical considerations when using logistic regression in decision-making processes?
