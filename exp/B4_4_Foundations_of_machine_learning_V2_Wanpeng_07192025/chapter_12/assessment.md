  B) To uncover hidden patterns in unlabeled data
  C) To classify data into predefined categories
  D) To improve supervised learning accuracy

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The main goal of unsupervised learning is to uncover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures from unlabeled data.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is a common technique used for dimensionality reduction?

  A) K-Means Clustering
  B) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  C) Decision Trees
  D) Neural Networks

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used technique for reducing dimensionality while retaining the essential information of the dataset.

**Question 3:** Which algorithm is known for generating new synthetic data through a competitive process?

  A) K-Means
  B) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  C) Autoencoders
  D) Support Vector Machines

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two competing neural networks: a generator that creates synthetic data and a discriminator that evaluates data authenticity.

**Question 4:** What is a common pitfall when applying unsupervised learning techniques?

  A) Lack of validation data
  B) Overfitting the model
  C) Unclear feature selection
  D) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Unsupervised learning heavily relies on feature selection; poor feature selection can lead to misleading insights and inaccurate patterns.

### Activities
- Have students form small groups and identify a real-world dataset suitable for unsupervised learning. Each group should discuss which unsupervised techniques could be applied and present their findings.

### Discussion Questions
- How do you select the number of clusters when using K-Means clustering?
- Can you explain the significance of feature selection in unsupervised learning?
- What are some limitations of unsupervised learning compared to supervised learning?
