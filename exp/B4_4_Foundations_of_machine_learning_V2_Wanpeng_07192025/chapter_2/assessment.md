**Question 3:** Which method can be used for feature selection?

  A) Recursive feature elimination
  B) Data sampling
  C) One-hot encoding
  D) Data augmentation

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Recursive feature elimination is a method for selecting features that is based on recursively considering smaller sets of features to identify the most useful ones.

**Question 4:** In feature engineering, what does 'feature extraction' refer to?

  A) Removing irrelevant features from the dataset
  B) Creating new features from existing data
  C) Deriving important information from raw data
  D) Selecting features based on their correlation with the target variable

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Feature extraction involves utilizing methods to derive important information from raw data, which can enhance model performance.

### Activities
- Review a dataset you are working with and identify three techniques for data preprocessing that would be beneficial. Present your findings and the reasoning behind your choices.
- Choose a dataset and perform a feature engineering exercise by creating at least two new features that might enhance a machine learning model's performance.

### Discussion Questions
- What challenges have you faced in data preprocessing, and how did you overcome them?
- In which situations would you choose to use feature creation over feature selection, and why?
