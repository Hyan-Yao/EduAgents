  A) To increase the training time.
  B) To introduce non-linearity into the model.
  C) To decrease model complexity.
  D) To eliminate the need for weights.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Activation functions introduce non-linearity, enabling neural networks to learn complex relationships in data.

**Question 4:** What is a major challenge faced by neural networks?

  A) High speed of training.
  B) Ability to easily generalize.
  C) Overfitting to training data.
  D) Inability to learn from labeled data.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise from the training data instead of the actual pattern, which is a common challenge in training neural networks.
