**Explanation:** DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is specifically designed to handle clusters of varying densities and can identify noise points.

**Question 4:** What is a common metric for evaluating the effectiveness of clustering?

  A) Mean Absolute Error
  B) Silhouette Score
  C) Root Mean Square Error
  D) Accuracy

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The Silhouette Score is a common metric used to assess how well-separated the clusters are, with higher scores indicating better-defined clusters.

### Activities
- Given a dataset, apply K-Means clustering and use the Elbow Method to determine the appropriate number of clusters. Present your findings and explain the chosen number of clusters.

### Discussion Questions
- How can clustering be applied in your field of interest? Can you think of a case study?
- What challenges do you see arising when clustering data in real-world applications?
