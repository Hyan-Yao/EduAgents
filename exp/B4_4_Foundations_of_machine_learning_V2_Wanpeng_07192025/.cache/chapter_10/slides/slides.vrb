\frametitle{Hierarchical Clustering - Dendrograms & Summary}
    \begin{block}{Dendrogram Representation}
        A dendrogram is a visual representation of the cluster hierarchy that shows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Clusters and their sub-clusters at various hierarchy levels.
            \item The distances at which clusters merge.
        \end{itemize}
        The height of branches illustrates the distance of merging; shorter branches indicate a stronger similarity.

    \begin{block}{Summary of Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Hierarchical clustering can be either agglomerative or divisive.
            \item There is no need to predefine the number of clusters.
            \item The output is a dendrogram that visualizes cluster relationships.
            \item Different linkage criteria define cluster formation.
            \item Useful for exploratory data analysis.
        \end{itemize}
        Use hierarchical clustering to explore potential groupings without a predefined structure.
