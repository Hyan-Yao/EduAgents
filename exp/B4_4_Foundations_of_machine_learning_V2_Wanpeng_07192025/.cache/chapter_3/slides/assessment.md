**Explanation:** Data quality is critical as poor-quality data can lead to inaccurate models and unreliable insights.

**Question 4:** What is one benefit of dimensionality reduction?

  A) It adds complexity to the model.
  B) It increases the number of features.
  C) It reduces training time while retaining information.
  D) It guarantees better accuracy.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Dimensionality reduction helps streamline the model by reducing the number of features, often leading to faster training times while retaining essential information.

### Activities
- Select a dataset and apply preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, normalization, and encoding. Document your process and the impact on the data.
- Experiment with feature engineering by creating new features from an existing dataset. Assess how these new features change the model's performance.

### Discussion Questions
- What challenges did you face during the data preprocessing phase, and how did you overcome them?
- How can the choice of features affect the performance of a machine learning model?
- In what scenarios would you prioritize feature selection over the creation of new features?
