### 2) Data-driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

- **Supplementary Resources:** 
  Introduce additional tutorials or workshops that focus on foundational machine learning concepts and practical tool usage, particularly at the onset of the course.

- **Adaptive Course Pacing:**
  Establish a flexible syllabus that allows for slower pacing in early topics. Utilize recorded lectures and supplemental materials for reinforcement.

- **Interactive Opportunities:**
  Increase the number of collaborative projects and peer assessments throughout the course to align with students' preferences for realistic and engaging learning experiences.

- **Regular Feedback Mechanisms:**
  Implement ongoing assessments, quizzes, and surveys to collect student feedback on understanding and engagement levels, enabling informed adjustments to course content and pacing.

- **Inclusivity in Instruction:**
  Ensure instructional materials are accessible and consider the diverse backgrounds and learning preferences of students. Training for faculty on inclusivity in teaching could enhance communication clarity.

By implementing these recommendations, the course can better cater to student needs, enhance engagement, and systematically address learning gaps in the "Foundations of Machine Learning" course.
