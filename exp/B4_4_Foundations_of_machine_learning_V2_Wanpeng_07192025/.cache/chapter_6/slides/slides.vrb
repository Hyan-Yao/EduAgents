\frametitle{Example of a Decision Tree}
    Consider a simple decision tree used to predict whether a customer will buy a product based on their age and income:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Root Node}: Is the income > \$50,000?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Yes}: Check age
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Is age < 30?
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{Yes}: Predict "Won't Buy"
                    \item \textbf{No}: Predict "Will Buy"
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{No}: Predict "Won't Buy"
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
