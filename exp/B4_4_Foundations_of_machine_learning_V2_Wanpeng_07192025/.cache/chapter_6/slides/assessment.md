- Reflect on the relevance and applications of decision trees in modern machine learning.
- Understand the importance of concepts such as pruning and splitting in decision tree construction.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is one of the key advantages of decision trees?

  A) They are complex and difficult to interpret.
  B) They require extensive feature engineering.
  C) They can handle non-linear relationships without transformations.
  D) They always perform better than neural networks.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Decision trees can capture non-linear relationships between features without the need for additional transformations.

**Question 2:** What does the term 'pruning' refer to in the context of decision trees?

  A) The process of adding more branches to the tree.
  B) Reducing the complexity of the tree by removing branches.
  C) Splitting data into new nodes.
  D) Making predictions without using any data.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Pruning is a technique used to simplify the tree by removing branches that do not provide significant power to the predictive capability, thus addressing overfitting.

**Question 3:** Which of the following is NOT a core component of decision trees?

  A) Leaf nodes
  B) Internal nodes
  C) Support vectors
  D) Root node

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Support vectors are associated with support vector machines, not decision trees. The core components are leaf nodes, internal nodes, and the root node.

**Question 4:** What is the primary goal of decision trees in supervised learning?

  A) To increase noise in the dataset.
  B) To minimize data preprocessing requirements.
  C) To make predictions based on input features.
  D) To create complex models that are difficult to understand.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The primary goal of decision trees is to make predictions based on the input features, which is central to supervised learning tasks.
