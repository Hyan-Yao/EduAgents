        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Combats Overfitting}: Ensures that models generalize well to unseen data.
            \item \textbf{Improves Interpretability}: Reduces complexity, making it easier to interpret feature effects.
            \item \textbf{Model Selection}: Helps in balancing bias and variance.
