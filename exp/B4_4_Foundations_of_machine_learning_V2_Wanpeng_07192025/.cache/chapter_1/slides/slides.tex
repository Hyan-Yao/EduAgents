\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is Machine Learning? - Definition}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, ML systems learn from data, identifying patterns and making decisions autonomously.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is Machine Learning? - Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data-Driven Learning}: ML uses large sets of data to train models. The more data available, the better the model can learn.
        \item \textbf{Algorithms}: At the core of ML are algorithms that enable learning from data. Common types include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Decision Trees
            \item Neural Networks
            \item Support Vector Machines
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Model}: A machine learning model is the result of training an algorithm on a dataset. It can then make predictions or decisions based on new data.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

                \item \textbf{Definition}: The model is trained on labeled data, where the outcome is known.
                \item \textbf{Example}: Predicting housing prices based on features like size and location.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Unsupervised Learning}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Definition}: The model is trained on unlabeled data and must find patterns on its own.
                \item \textbf{Example}: Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Reinforcement Learning}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Definition}: Learning is based on rewards and penalties, guiding the model to achieve a specific goal through trial and error.
                \item \textbf{Example}: Training a robot to navigate a maze.

    \frametitle{Introduction to Ethics in Machine Learning}
    Machine learning (ML) is transforming industries, driving innovation, and making life easier for millions. 
    However, as we harness the power of algorithms and data, it's critical to consider the ethical implications of these technologies. 
    
    Ethics and bias must be at the forefront of your learning and implementation process in ML practices.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Key Concepts}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Ethics in Machine Learning}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Ethics refers to the moral principles that govern behavior.
                \item In ML, it involves ensuring fairness, accountability, and transparency in decisions.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Bias}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Occurs when training data reflects societal prejudices or disparities.
                \item Can lead to discriminatory outcomes based on race, gender, nationality, or other characteristics.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Examples of Ethical Challenges}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Facial Recognition Technology}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Misidentification of individuals from minority groups leads to wrongful accusations and privacy violations.
                \item Example: A high-profile case where an innocent person was detained.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Hiring Algorithms}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item ML tools may eliminate candidates based on biased training data.
                \item Example: A recruitment tool favors male candidates due to historical data from male-dominated industries.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Transparency}: Clarify how models make decisions and adopt interpretable ML approaches.
        \item \textbf{Accountability}: Establish guidelines for ML use to take responsibility for algorithm consequences.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Code Snippet: Detecting Bias}
    Here is a simple Python code snippet to assess bias in a classification model using demographic parity:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Example dataset: true labels and predicted labels
y_true = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]  # True labels
y_pred = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  # Predicted labels

# Assessing confusion matrix
tn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred).ravel()

# Calculate bias metric: True Positive Rate (TPR) & False Positive Rate (FPR)
tpr = tp / (tp + fn)  # Formula for True Positive Rate
fpr = fp / (fp + tn)  # Formula for False Positive Rate

print("True Positive Rate:", tpr)
print("False Positive Rate:", fpr)
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}
