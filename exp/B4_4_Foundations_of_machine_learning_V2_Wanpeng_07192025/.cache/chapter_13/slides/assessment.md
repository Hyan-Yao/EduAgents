  D) States, Input, Output, Learning Rate

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The core components of Reinforcement Learning are Agent, Environment, Actions, States, and Rewards that define how the agent interacts with its environment.

**Question 2:** What does 'exploration vs exploitation' refer to in Reinforcement Learning?

  A) Choosing between different algorithms.
  B) The trade-off between trying new actions and leveraging known profitable actions.
  C) Balancing past performance and future potential.
  D) Selecting states based on unrelated variables.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** 'Exploration vs exploitation' is a fundamental concept in RL where an agent has to decide between exploring new actions to discover more rewards and exploiting known actions that yield immediate rewards.

**Question 3:** Which of the following algorithms is known for its effectiveness in solving large state spaces?

  A) Linear Regression
  B) Q-learning
  C) Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
  D) K-Means Clustering

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are used in RL to approximate the Q-value function for large state spaces, enabling the agent to learn directly from high-dimensional sensory input.

**Question 4:** What is the main benefit of reward shaping in reinforcement learning?

  A) It decreases the complexity of algorithms.
  B) It facilitates faster learning by providing additional guidance to the agent.
  C) It avoids the need for simulation.
  D) It guarantees optimal actions.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Reward shaping offers additional signals to guide the agent's learning process, typically leading to faster convergence on the desired behavior.

### Activities
- Group Discussion: Form small groups to discuss potential real-world applications of RL in industries like healthcare, finance, or transportation. Each group should identify a specific problem that RL could help solve and present their ideas.
- Question Exchange: Prepare two questions on Reinforcement Learning to exchange with a peer. Discuss each other's questions and attempt to answer them together, focusing on clarifying concepts.

### Discussion Questions
- What challenges do you see in implementing reinforcement learning in real-world scenarios?
- Can you share an example where you believe RL could significantly improve an existing technology or process?
- What ethical considerations should be addressed when deploying RL systems in sensitive domains?
