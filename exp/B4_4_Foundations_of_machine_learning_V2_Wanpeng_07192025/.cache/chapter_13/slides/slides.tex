\begin{frame}{Introduction to Core Concepts}
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Understanding the following core concepts is crucial to grasp the mechanics of RL.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Core Concepts Explained}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Agent}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item The learner or decision-maker in the RL scenario.
              \item Example: An algorithm controlling a character in a video game.
          \end{itemize}
          
        \item \textbf{Environment}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Everything the agent interacts with; it defines the context.
              \item Example: The game, including terrain and characters.
          \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Actions}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item The set of all possible moves the agent can take.
              \item Example: Moving a pawn or castling in chess. 
          \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{States}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item A snapshot of the environment that provides information for decision-making.
              \item Example: The arrangement of chess pieces on the board.
          \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Rewards}:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item A feedback signal received after taking an action in a specific state, 
                usually a numerical value.
              \item Example: Scoring points in a video game after completing a level.
          \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Temporal Aspect}: The agent learns over time from the consequences of past actions.
        \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation}: Balancing exploration of new actions with exploiting known rewarding actions.
        \item \textbf{Objective}: The goal is to develop a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Related Formulation}
    In formal terms, Reinforcement Learning can be structured as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The agent interacts with the environment at discrete time steps, \( t \).
        \item States, actions, and rewards can be represented by:
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{equation}
      R(s, a) = \textit{reward for taking action } a \textit{ in state } s
    \end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Code Snippet Example}
    Consider a simplified representation of an RL agent's decision process:
    
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class RLAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = None
        self.policy = {}  # Mapping from states to actions

    def choose_action(self, state):
        # Implementing a simple policy based on current state
        return self.policy.get(state, 'default_action')

    def receive_reward(self, reward):
        # Update agent's understanding based on received reward
        pass
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
    Mastering these core concepts of agent, environment, actions, states, and rewards lays the foundation for understanding more advanced topics in Reinforcement Learning, including learning algorithms and policy optimization techniques.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Types of Reinforcement Learning - Overview}
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a paradigm in machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment.
  
  This slide discusses two primary types of RL:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Model-Based Learning}
      \item \textbf{Model-Free Learning}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Types of Reinforcement Learning - Model-Based Learning}
  
  \textbf{Definition:}
  In model-based reinforcement learning, the agent builds an internal model of the environment to predict future states and expected rewards.
  
  \textbf{Key Characteristics:}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Planning:} Allows simulation of future actions.
      \item \textbf{Learning from Fewer Samples:} Reduces the number of interactions needed with the environment.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \textbf{Example:}
  Consider a chess-playing AI that simulates moves and outcomes to select the best one.
  
  \textbf{Illustration:}
  Imagine a driver using a roadmap to predict traffic conditions based on past experiences.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Types of Reinforcement Learning - Model-Free Learning}

  \textbf{Definition:}
  In model-free reinforcement learning, the agent learns directly from interactions without creating a model of the environment.
  
  \textbf{Key Characteristics:}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Simplicity:} Easier to implement; focuses on direct experience.
      \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation:} Balances trying new actions and using known high-reward actions.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Examples:}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Q-Learning:} Learns values of action-state pairs directly.
      \item \textbf{SARSA:} Updates Q-values based on actual actions taken.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Illustration:}
  Imagine a robot navigating a maze by trial and error and refining its strategy over time.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)}
  
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a mathematical framework used for modeling decision-making situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker.
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{block}{Key Components}
    An MDP is defined by five key components:
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Components of an MDP}
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{States (S)}: A finite set of states that represent all possible configurations of the environment.
    \item \textbf{Actions (A)}: A finite set of possible actions available to the agent in each state.
    \item \textbf{Transition Function (P)}: Defines the probability of moving from one state to another given a specific action, represented as \( P(s'|s, a) \).
    \item \textbf{Reward Function (R)}: Assigns a numerical reward received after transitioning from one state to another due to an action, denoted as \( R(s, a) \).
    \item \textbf{Discount Factor ($\gamma$)}: A value between 0 and 1 that discounts future rewards.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{How MDPs Work}
  
  MDPs utilize a policy \( \pi \) that maps states to actions, guiding the agent in action selection.
  
  \begin{block}{Bellman Equation}
    A key feature is the Bellman equation, relating the value of a state to its successor states:
    \begin{equation}
      V(s) = R(s, \pi(s)) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s, \pi(s)) V(s')
    \end{equation}
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{block}{Example of MDP in Practice}
    Consider a robot navigating a grid:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item States: Each cell in the grid.
      \item Actions: Moving up, down, left, or right.
      \item Transition Function: Probability of slipping while moving.
      \item Reward Function: +10 for reaching the goal, -10 for falling off a cliff.
      \item Discount Factor: Closer to 1 for immediate rewards.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item MDPs are foundational to reinforcement learning (RL).
    \item They model uncertainty through probabilistic transitions and rewards.
    \item Understanding MDPs is crucial for developing algorithms like Q-learning and Policy Gradient methods.
  \end{itemize}
  
  MDPs enable effective decision-making across a variety of applications from robotics to game playing.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Exploration vs. Exploitation}
    \begin{block}{Understanding Exploration vs. Exploitation}
        In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents face a fundamental dilemma: 
        \textbf{exploration} vs. \textbf{exploitation}.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration}: Actions to discover new strategies or gather information about the environment.
        \item \textbf{Exploitation}: Using known information to maximize the reward with the current knowledge.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Key Concept}
        The goal of an RL agent is to maximize cumulative rewards over time, requiring a balance between exploring unknown actions and exploiting known, rewarding actions.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{The Dilemma Illustrated}
    \begin{block}{Scenario}
        Imagine an agent navigating a maze:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If it tries different paths (exploration), it might find a shortcut or the exit.
            \item If it always chooses the same path (exploitation), it may miss better routes or solutions.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{center}
        \texttt{[Exploration]} \\
        \texttt{    /   \\} 
        \texttt{   A     B} \\
        \texttt{  /       \\} 
        \texttt{ X         Y  [Exploitation]} \\
        \texttt{(A â€“ known route, B â€“ new route)}
    \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Strategies to Balance Exploration and Exploitation}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Epsilon-Greedy Strategy}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Choose best action with probability \(1 - \epsilon\) and explore a random action with probability \(\epsilon\).
            \item Adjust \(\epsilon\) over time.
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{equation}
            a_t = 
            \begin{cases} 
            \text{random action} & \text{with probability } \epsilon \\ 
            \text{argmax}_a Q(s, a) & \text{with probability } 1 - \epsilon 
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}

        \item \textbf{UCB (Upper Confidence Bound)}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Balance between trying less explored actions and exploiting high-reward actions.
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{equation}
            a_t = \text{argmax}_a \left( 
            \overline{X}_a + c \sqrt{\frac{\ln T}{n_a}} 
            \right)
        \end{equation}
        
        \item \textbf{Softmax Action Selection}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Actions are chosen proportionate to their estimated value.
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{equation}
            P(a) = \frac{e^{Q(s,a)/\tau}}{\sum_{b} e^{Q(s,b)/\tau}}
        \end{equation}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Takeaways}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Balancing exploration and exploitation is crucial for effective learning in RL.
        \item Strategies like Epsilon-Greedy, UCB, and Softmax selection are widely used to strike this balance.
        \item Continuous assessment and adjustment of strategies based on the problem context can optimize agent performance.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        By understanding and applying these concepts, students can enhance their grasp of how RL agents learn and make decisions in complex environments.

    \frametitle{Rewards in Reinforcement Learning - Understanding Rewards}
    In reinforcement learning (RL), \textbf{rewards} are critical feedback signals that inform an agent about the effectiveness of its actions in achieving a defined goal.
    
    \begin{block}{Key Concepts}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Definition of Reward:} A scalar value given to an agent after it performs an action in a given state. It measures success or failure.
            \item \textbf{Types of Rewards:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Immediate Rewards:} Provided right after an action (e.g., scoring a point).
                \item \textbf{Delayed Rewards:} Occur after several actions (e.g., points awarded at the end of a puzzle).
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reward Structure:} Affects the learning process; sparse versus dense rewards lead to different trajectories.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Rewards in Reinforcement Learning - Impacts on Learning}
    The design of the reward structure can influence both the learning speed and the final performance of the RL agent.
    
    \begin{block}{Example: Maze Navigation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Dense Reward:} Small reward for each step may lead to many small steps without considering the overall path.
            \item \textbf{Sparse Reward:} Large reward upon exiting the maze encourages focus on the significant goal, potentially delaying learning.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Rewards in Reinforcement Learning - Formulas}
    The reward function \( R(s, a) \) defines the reward received after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).
    
    \begin{block}{Cumulative Reward}
        We often are interested in the cumulative reward over time, defined as:
        \begin{equation}
            R_t = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k}
        \end{equation}
        where \( R_t \) is the cumulative reward starting from time \( t \), \( r_t \) is the reward at time \( t \), and \( \gamma \) (0 â‰¤ \( \gamma \) < 1) is the discount factor prioritizing immediate rewards.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Rewards in Reinforcement Learning - Conclusion}
    In summary, understanding reward structures is paramount for designing effective reinforcement learning algorithms.
    
    \begin{block}{Key Takeaway}
        Balancing immediate and delayed rewards while ensuring that the structure aligns with overall learning objectives will facilitate better learning and adaptability in RL agents.

    \frametitle{Value Functions - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Understanding Value Functions}
        Value functions are crucial elements in reinforcement learning that estimate the expected long-term rewards from any given state or action. They guide decision-making over time.

        \item Evaluate the desirability of states and actions
        \item Critical for many reinforcement learning algorithms

                    V(s) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ R_t | S_t = s \right]
                \end{equation}
                \item \textbf{Example:} In a grid world, $V(s_1)$ reflects expected rewards from state $s_1$.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Action-Value Function (Q)}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Definition:} Represents expected return from taking action $a$ in state $s$ under policy $\pi$.
                \item \textbf{Formula:}
                \begin{equation}
                    Q(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ R_t | S_t = s, A_t = a \right]
                \end{equation}
                \item \textbf{Example:} In a grid world, $Q(s_1, a)$ quantifies anticipated rewards after taking action $a$ from $s_1$.

    \frametitle{Policy in Reinforcement Learning - Definition}
    \begin{block}{Definition of Policy}
        In Reinforcement Learning (RL), a **policy** is a strategy employed by an agent to determine its actions based on the current state. 
        Formally, a policy can be defined as:
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Deterministic Policy}: A function \( \pi: S \rightarrow A \) that maps each state \( s \) directly to an action \( a \).
        \item \textbf{Stochastic Policy}: A function \( \pi: S \times A \rightarrow [0, 1] \) that represents the probability of taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Policy in Reinforcement Learning - Role}
    \begin{block}{Role of Policy in Guiding Behavior}
        The policy is crucial because it directly influences the agent's behavior within the environment.
    \end{block}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Action Selection}: Determines the next action based on the current state, either deterministically or stochastically.
        \item \textbf{Learning \& Adaptation}: Agents adjust their policies to maximize cumulative rewards, employing exploration and exploitation techniques.
