    \begin{block}{Return}
        The total discounted reward received over time, calculated as:
        \begin{equation}
            G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + ...
        \end{equation}
        where \( \gamma \) (0 â‰¤ \( \gamma \) < 1) is the discount factor prioritizing immediate rewards.
