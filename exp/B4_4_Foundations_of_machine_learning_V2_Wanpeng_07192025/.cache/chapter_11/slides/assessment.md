  B) By simplifying algorithms leading to faster processing
  C) By completely removing the need for data analysis
  D) By adding more dimensions to the data

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Dimensionality reduction simplifies the data, which can lead to faster processing times and reduced computational resource requirements.

**Question 3:** Which technique is commonly associated with dimensionality reduction?

  A) K-means Clustering
  B) Decision Trees
  C) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  D) Neural Networks

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely recognized techniques for reducing dimensionality while preserving variance.

**Question 4:** What is a benefit of using autoencoders for dimensionality reduction?

  A) They are only suitable for linear data.
  B) They reduce dimensions while capturing non-linear relationships.
