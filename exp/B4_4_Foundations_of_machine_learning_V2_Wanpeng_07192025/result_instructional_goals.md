Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

1. **Apply Machine Learning Techniques**:  
   - Students will apply machine learning techniques—including classification, regression, and clustering—to solve specified real-world problems, demonstrating practical competence through case studies.

2. **Evaluate Model Performance**:  
   - Students will evaluate and compare the performance of machine learning models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and critically assess the implications of their findings.

3. **Preprocess and Analyze Data**:  
   - Students will preprocess and analyze datasets by employing techniques such as normalization, encoding categorical variables, and feature extraction, preparing data effectively for machine learning tasks.

4. **Understand Ethical Considerations**:  
   - Students will critically evaluate the ethical implications and potential biases of machine learning methods, engaging in scenario-based discussions to deepen their understanding of responsible technology usage.

5. **Collaborate on High Impact Projects**:  
   - Students will work collaboratively on a final project that integrates machine learning techniques to address a specific problem or case study, incorporating peer assessments and presentations to enhance teamwork and communication skills.
