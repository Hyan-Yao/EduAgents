### Course Overview
This course introduces students to the foundational principles and techniques of machine learning. Students will learn to implement key algorithms, evaluate model performance, preprocess data, and understand the ethical implications of machine learning applications.

### Course Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. **Apply Machine Learning Techniques:** Utilize classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and neural networks to solve real-world problems.
2. **Evaluate Model Performance:** Assess and compare the performance of various machine learning models using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
3. **Preprocess and Analyze Data:** Employ data preprocessing techniques to prepare datasets effectively for machine learning tasks.
4. **Understand Ethical Considerations:** Critically evaluate the ethical implications and limitations of machine learning technologies.

### Required Course Materials
- **Textbook:** 
   - "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop (2nd Ed.)
- **Additional Readings:** Supplementary articles and case studies will be provided throughout the course and accessed via Canvas.
- **Software:** Google Colab, Python Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
