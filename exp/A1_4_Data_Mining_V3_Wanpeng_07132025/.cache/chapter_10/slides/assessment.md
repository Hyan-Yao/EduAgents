**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Reinforcement Learning learns to optimize behaviors through interaction with the environment rather than relying on labeled data.

**Question 4:** In the context of RL, what does the term 'exploration' refer to?

  A) Utilizing known data only
  B) Searching for new actions to identify rewards
  C) Summarizing past experiences
  D) Ignoring potential long-term rewards

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Exploration in RL refers to the agent's attempt to discover new actions that may yield higher rewards instead of exploiting known ones.

### Activities
- Create a flowchart illustrating the reinforcement learning process including key components such as the agent, environment, actions, and rewards.
- Develop a small project where you apply Q-Learning to a simplified problem (like a grid world) using available libraries.

### Discussion Questions
- In your opinion, what is the most promising future application of Reinforcement Learning and why?
- How do you think Reinforcement Learning could impact the job market in the next decade?
