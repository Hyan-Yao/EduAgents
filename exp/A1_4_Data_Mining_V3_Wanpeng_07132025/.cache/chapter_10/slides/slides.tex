    \frametitle{Classic Reinforcement Learning Algorithms - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Introduction}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on how agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize rewards. 
        Key algorithms foundational to the field include Q-learning and SARSA.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Q-learning**: Off-policy algorithm learning the value of optimal actions.
        \item **SARSA**: On-policy algorithm updating Q-values based on the action taken by the agent.
        \item Understanding these algorithms is vital for grasping more complex RL methods.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Q-Learning}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm that learns the value of the optimal action-selection policy, independent of the agent's actions.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Update Rule}
        The Q-value is updated using the Bellman equation:
        \begin{equation}
        Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left[ r_t + \gamma \max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s_t, a_t) \right]
        \end{equation}
        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( \alpha \) = Learning rate ($0 < \alpha \leq 1$)
            \item \( r_t \) = Reward received after taking action \( a_t \)
            \item \( \gamma \) = Discount factor ($0 \leq \gamma < 1$)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Off-Policy: Learns the value of the optimal policy regardless of actions taken.
            \item Exploration vs. Exploitation: Balances new actions (exploration) with known rewards (exploitation).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Illustration}
        Q-learning helps a robot navigate a grid by learning which actions yield the best long-term rewards through repeated interactions with its environment.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{SARSA}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        SARSA is an on-policy algorithm that updates Q-values based on the action actually taken by the agent, denoted by \( s_t, a_t \) for current state and action and \( s_{t+1}, a_{t+1} \) for the next state and action.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Update Rule}
        The update equation is:
        \begin{equation}
        Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left[ r_t + \gamma Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t) \right]
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item On-Policy: Learns the value of the policy being followed by the agent.
            \item Focus on Current Policy: Considers the action taken in the next state, leading to conservative policies.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Illustration}
        SARSA aids a self-driving car in navigating a complex traffic system by learning from the actions it actually takes, adapting to traffic situations based on real-world experiences.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Summary of Q-Learning and SARSA}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Q-Learning:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Off-policy, learns optimal actions regardless of the agent's path.
