Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

1. **Technical Proficiency**: Students will demonstrate proficiency in applying and explaining a range of data mining techniques, including classification (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks) and clustering, to analyze real-world datasets.

2. **Performance Evaluation**: Students will evaluate and compare the performance of different data mining models using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and techniques like cross-validation.

3. **Hands-on Experience**: Students will complete and present a comprehensive project leveraging at least three different data mining techniques on diverse datasets, requiring them to preprocess data, apply appropriate techniques, interpret results, and discuss their implications.

4. **Advanced Concepts**: Students will explore and explain advanced data mining topics, including generative models, natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning, and apply them in specific case studies.

5. **Collaborative Learning**: Students will work in groups to solve practical data mining problems, effectively communicate their approaches and findings through presentations, and critique peer presentations constructively.
