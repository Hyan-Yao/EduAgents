\begin{frame}[fragile]{Training Neural Networks - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Overview of the Training Process}
        Training a neural network involves adjusting its parameters (weights and biases) to learn from data and make accurate predictions. The training process consists of three key steps:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Forward Propagation
            \item Loss Function Evaluation
            \item Backpropagation
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Training Neural Networks - Forward Propagation}
    \frametitle{Forward Propagation}
    \begin{block}{Concept}
        Forward propagation is the process of passing input data through the network layer by layer, from the input layer to the output layer.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Consider an image classification task where the input is an image of a cat. The network processes the image layer by layer to generate an output, such as "cat" or "not cat".
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Mathematical Representation}
        For a single layer:
        \begin{equation}
            z = W \cdot x + b
        \end{equation}
        where $z$ is the output before activation, $W$ is the weight matrix, $x$ is the input vector, and $b$ is the bias.
        
        Activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid):
        \begin{equation}
            a = \text{activation}(z)
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        The output of each neuron influences the signal passed to the next layer, affecting the final output of the network.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Training Neural Networks - Loss Functions and Backpropagation}
    \frametitle{Loss Functions and Backpropagation}
    
    \begin{block}{Loss Functions}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Concept}: A loss function quantifies the difference between predicted outcomes and actual outcomes. The objective is to minimize this loss.
            \item \textbf{Example}: In binary classification, the binary cross-entropy loss function could be used:
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{equation}
            L(y, \hat{y}) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right]
        \end{equation}
        where $y$ is the actual label and $\hat{y}$ is the predicted probability.
    
        \begin{block}{Key Points}
            A well-chosen loss function is essential as it provides feedback for model performance adjustments.
        \end{block}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Backpropagation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Concept}: Backpropagation updates the weights based on the calculated loss, using gradient descent to minimize this loss.
            \item \textbf{Formula}: Weight update rule:
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{equation}
            W \gets W - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial W}
        \end{equation}
        where $\eta$ is the learning rate.

        \begin{block}{Visual Representation}
            Imagine a hill representing the loss landscape; backpropagation finds the steepest path down.
        \end{block}

        \begin{block}{Key Points}
            The iterative process (forward propagation → loss calculation → backpropagation) is repeated for many epochs until effective learning is achieved.
        \end{block}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Training Neural Networks - Summary}
    \frametitle{Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Forward Propagation}: Input data flows through the network to generate predictions.
        \item \textbf{Loss Functions}: Measure the accuracy of predictions, informing model adjustments.
        \item \textbf{Backpropagation}: Updates weights to minimize the loss, critical for refining model performance.

        When assessing the performance of a neural network, it is essential to use specific metrics that provide insight into how well the model is performing. Below are the primary metrics used in evaluating neural networks:
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Evaluating Neural Network Performance - Accuracy}
    \begin{block}{1. Accuracy}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances in the dataset.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Where}: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item TP = True Positives
                \item TN = True Negatives
                \item FP = False Positives
                \item FN = False Negatives
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If a model classifies 70 out of 100 instances correctly, the accuracy would be 70\%.
            \item \textbf{Key Points}: High accuracy does not always mean the model is effective, especially in cases of imbalanced datasets.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Evaluating Neural Network Performance - Precision, Recall, F1-Score}
    \begin{block}{2. Precision}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: The ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total predicted positive instances.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If a model predicts 30 instances as positive, of which 25 are correct, precision is \(\frac{25}{30} \approx 0.83\), or 83\%.
            \item \textbf{Key Points}: Precision is critical when false positives are costly, like in medical diagnoses.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{3. Recall (Sensitivity)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: The ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the actual total positives.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If there are 40 actual positives and the model identifies 30 correctly, the recall is \(\frac{30}{40} = 0.75\), or 75\%.
            \item \textbf{Key Points}: Recall is crucial where missing a positive instance is more detrimental, such as detecting fraud.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{4. F1-Score}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{F1-Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If Precision = 0.83 and Recall = 0.75, then the F1-Score is approximately 0.79.
            \item \textbf{Key Points}: The F1-Score is especially important in scenarios with class imbalance.
