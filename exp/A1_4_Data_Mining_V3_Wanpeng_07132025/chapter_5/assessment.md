**Explanation:** Supervised learning is widely used for fraud detection in banking, where it learns from labeled examples of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

**Question 4:** What is a key benefit of using supervised learning in data mining?

  A) It eliminates the need for data.
  B) It allows for the automatic analysis of large datasets.
  C) It ensures 100% accuracy in predictions.
  D) It relies solely on human intuition for model building.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Supervised learning enables the automatic analysis and modeling of large datasets, enhancing decision-making processes through data insights.

### Activities
- Develop a small project where you apply a supervised learning algorithm to a dataset. Choose a classification or regression task that interests you and present your findings.
- Create a flowchart that outlines the steps involved in the supervised learning process, from data collection to model evaluation.

### Discussion Questions
