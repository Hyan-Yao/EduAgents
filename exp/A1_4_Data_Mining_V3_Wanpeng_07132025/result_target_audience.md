Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

### 1) Comprehensive Profile of Target Students

**Student Background**
- **Demographics**: 
  - Approximately 150 graduate students, predominantly from Computer Science disciplines, with a 60% international and 40% domestic ratio.
  
**Prerequisite Knowledge**
- **Programming Skills**: 
  - High proficiency in Python across most students, which aligns with course focus on data mining applications.
- **Machine Learning Foundations**: 
  - Variable exposure to machine learning concepts, with potential challenges in understanding data mining techniques (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).

**Career Aspirations**
- Many students are aiming for roles in data science, analytics, or research, necessitating practical, applicable knowledge in data mining techniques and real-world data handling.

**Knowledge Gaps**
- **Data Mining Techniques**: 
  - Insufficient understanding of techniques such as clustering, impacting project engagement.
- **Quantitative Skills**: 
  - Gaps in probability and linear algebra may hinder comprehension of evaluation metrics and algorithm functionalities.
- **Familiarity with Tools**: 
  - Uneven experience with Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) and Google Colab suggests the need for foundational sessions.

**Learning Needs**
- **Programming Confidence**: 
  - Workshops to enhance confidence among less experienced Python users.
- **Clarified Instructions**: 
  - Simplification of course instructions to support understanding, particularly for international students.
- **Practical Application Skills**: 
  - Emphasis on projects with real datasets to strengthen understanding and application of data mining techniques.
- **Collaboration and Communication Skills**: 
  - Strategies to support group project dynamics, particularly for international students.

### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Enhanced Resources**: Introduce preparatory workshops focused on data mining techniques, Python libraries, and Google Colab usage to ensure all students start with a foundational knowledge.

2. **Structured Support**: Implement additional resources, such as expanded office hours with TAs and a dedicated online help forum for students to ask questions and gain insights.

3. **Clear Instruction and Feedback**: Provide instructional materials that simplify complex concepts and foster consistent, constructive feedback on students’ project progress.

4. **Active Learning**: Incorporate peer-teaching opportunities, encouraging students to present complex topics to each other, thereby reinforcing their understanding and improving communication skills.

5. **Assessment Flexibility**: Design assessments to favor project-based work over traditional exams, reflecting students’ preference for practical applications and mitigating stress associated with high-stakes tests.

These adjustments will create a supportive, inclusive learning environment that bridges knowledge gaps and aligns with students' professional aspirations in data mining and related fields.
