- Summarize the various clustering methodologies and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the primary purpose of clustering techniques in data mining?

  A) To analyze data trends over time.
  B) To partition data into distinct groups.
  C) To predict future data values.
  D) To visualize datasets in two dimensions.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The primary purpose of clustering techniques is to partition a dataset into distinct groups with similar characteristics.

**Question 2:** Which of the following algorithms is an example of hierarchical clustering?

  A) K-means
  B) DBSCAN
  C) Agglomerative clustering
  D) Gaussian Mixture Model

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Agglomerative clustering is a representative example of hierarchical clustering techniques.

**Question 3:** What scenario best illustrates the use of density-based clustering methods like DBSCAN?

  A) Segmenting customer purchase history.
  B) Identifying clusters based on geographic event concentrations.
  C) Hierarchical topic organization.
  D) Grouping image pixels based on RGB color values.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Density-based clustering is superb for identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes, such as geographic locations with high event density.

**Question 4:** Which evaluation metric measures the separation of clusters in clustering results?

  A) Silhouette Score
  B) Mean Squared Error
  C) Precision
  D) Recall

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** The Silhouette Score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, indicating the quality of separation.

### Activities
- Explore an open dataset (such as one from the UCI Machine Learning Repository) and apply different clustering algorithms. Document the outcomes and compare the effectiveness of each algorithm in revealing patterns within the data.
- Choose a dataset of your choice and implement k-means clustering on it. Determine the optimal number of clusters to use and analyze the results.

### Discussion Questions
