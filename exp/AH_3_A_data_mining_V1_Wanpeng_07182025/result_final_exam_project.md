# Final Project Plan: Comprehensive Data Mining Project

## Project Description
The comprehensive data mining project is designed as a collaborative effort where students apply data mining techniques to address a real-world problem. This project encourages teamwork, critical thinking, ethical considerations, and effective communication, serving as a practical replacement for a traditional final exam.

## Objectives
1. Demonstrate an understanding of data mining fundamentals.
2. Apply data analysis techniques using statistical methods and industry-standard tools.
3. Collaboratively develop and evaluate predictive models.
4. Analyze ethical implications and data governance in data mining.
5. Execute a comprehensive data mining project from inception to completion.
6. Communicate methodologies and results clearly.
