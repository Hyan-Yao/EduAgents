### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Math Skills Prerequisite Workshops:**
   - Conduct supplementary workshops or online resources covering essential mathematics (statistical reasoning, linear algebra) prior to or concurrently with the course.

2. **Hands-On Tool Training:**
   - Implement dedicated lab sessions early in the course focused on practical applications of Python, R, and Weka, starting from simple data tasks to progressively complex analyses.

3. **Structured Collaboration Training:**
   - Introduce an early module focusing on effective collaboration and project management, including role-playing scenarios to simulate team dynamics.

4. **Ethics in Data Mining Case Studies:**
   - Integrate real-world case studies on data ethics and governance throughout the curriculum, fostering discussions and critical thinking around responsible data usage.

5. **Transparent Assessment Framework:**
   - Clearly outline assessment criteria with detailed rubrics for each assessment type, providing sample projects or peer reviews to help clarify expectations and alleviate performance anxiety.

6. **Continuous Feedback Loop:**
   - Establish regular surveys or anonymous feedback forms after each module to adapt the course in real-time based on student input and needs, fostering a responsive educational environment.
