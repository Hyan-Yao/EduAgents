# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: AH_3_A_data_mining

## Faculty Expertise Requirements
1. **Subject Matter Expertise**:
   - In-depth knowledge of data mining fundamentals and industry-relevant methodologies.
   - Proficiency in statistical data analysis techniques and the application of various algorithms (decision trees, neural networks, clustering).
   - Understanding of ethical implications related to data governance and data privacy laws.

2. **Technical Skills**:
   - Familiarity with data mining tools such as Python, R, and Weka. 
   - Ability to teach students how to effectively use these tools in project-based learning environments.

3. **Interpersonal Skills**:
   - Strong communication skills to convey complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
   - Effective reporting and presentation strategies.

## Necessary Computing Resources
1. **Hardware**:
   - Laptops/desktops with sufficient computing power for students to run data mining software and conduct analyses.
   - Potential requirement for high-performance computing resources based on the size and complexity of datasets used in projects.

2. **Software**:
   - Access to industry-standard data mining tools (Python, R, Weka).
   - Specific libraries or packages (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn for Python) must be available.
   - Optional visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) for presenting findings from projects.

## Scheduling Considerations
1. **Class Timing**:
   - Classes should be scheduled according to students' availability while considering computer lab access.
   - Project schedules should align with assessment deadlines to provide adequate preparation time for students.

2. **TA Support**:
   - Ensure TA availability during lab or project sessions to assist with technical issues or course material questions.

## Facility Limitations
1. **Classroom Requirements**:
   - Classrooms must be equipped with computers capable of running necessary software.
   - Consider reserving a dedicated computer lab for data analysis if traditional classrooms are not suitable.

2. **Max Slide Count**:
   - Adhere to the institutional limit of a maximum slide count of 2 for presentations, which requires clear material structuring.

## Additional Constraints
1. **Math Skills Requirement**:
   - Define and incorporate foundational math skills as a prerequisite within the syllabus, providing resources or workshops to bridge skill gaps.

2. **Weekly Schedule Outline**:
   - Develop a structured weekly schedule outlining topics, assignments, and assessment methods to ensure clarity and coherence.

3. **Assessment Diversity**:
   - Plan for a diverse range of assessment methods including quizzes and peer evaluations to effectively measure student understanding and provide multiple feedback avenues.

## Summary
To effectively deliver the **AH_3_A_data_mining** course, key considerations include appropriate faculty expertise, sufficient computing resources, strategic scheduling, and facility requirements. Addressing foundational math skills and adhering to institutional policies on material format will enhance the learning experience. Each of these components is essential for the course's feasibility and successful implementation.
