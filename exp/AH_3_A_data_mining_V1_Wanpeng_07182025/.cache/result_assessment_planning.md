## Assessment Structure

### 1. Team Project (Cumulative Final Project - 30%)
- **Description**: Students work in teams on a comprehensive data mining project, from problem definition to model deployment, culminating in a presentation and report.
- **Milestones**:
  - **Project Proposal** (Week 11): Submit a proposal on the dataset, research question, and initial methodology (.pdf via Canvas).
  - **Progress Report** (Week 12): Brief report on progress with findings and challenges (.pdf via Canvas).
  - **Final Project Report** (Week 14): Comprehensive report on methodologies, results, and insights (.pdf or .ipynb via Canvas).
  - **Presentation** (Week 14): 10-minute presentation of findings to the class, 2-slide limit (Zoom or in-person).

### 2. Weekly Quizzes (20%)
- **Description**: Short quizzes focusing on the week’s topics to ensure foundational concepts are grasped.
- **Format**: Combination of multiple-choice (MCQs) and open-ended questions, administered via Canvas.
- **Timing**: Weekly, with a 30-minute time limit.

### 3. Assignments (30%)
- **Description**: Practical assignments tied to weekly topics, promoting real-world application of concepts.
- **Submission Format**: .ipynb (Jupyter Notebooks) or .pdf via Canvas.
- **Examples**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing assignment due in Week 3.
  - Mini-project using neural networks due in Week 7.

### 4. Participation and Peer Evaluation (20%)
- **Description**: Active participation in class discussions and peer evaluations of team members’ contributions.
- **Evaluation**: Peer evaluations based on a provided rubric (submitted via Canvas).
