# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery
## Course: B3_3_Foundations_of_machine_learning

### Faculty Expertise Requirements
1. **Machine Learning Knowledge**:
   - Faculty must possess a thorough understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts suitable for undergraduate students with minimal math involvement.
   - Expertise should include familiarity with various data types, analysis techniques, and applications within Artificial Intelligence (AI).

2. **Teaching Experience**:
   - Instructors should have experience teaching at the undergraduate level, particularly in subjects that require conceptual explanations rather than complex mathematical proofs.
   - Exposure to ethics in data analysis, albeit at a simplified level, is essential to address ethical considerations that arise in AI applications.

### Computing Resources
1. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - Availability of computer labs or student access to laptops/home computers equipped with specifications sufficient to run essential data science platforms and machine learning tools.
   - Provision of high-performance computing resources should be considered for model evaluation tasks, especially when using cloud services.

2. **Software Requirements**:
   - Access to user-friendly data science platforms such as Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks, and TensorFlow to facilitate model building without requiring extensive programming skills.
   - Inclusion of data visualization tools such as Tableau or basic visualization libraries in Python/R is essential for effective data analysis support.

### Software Requirements
- **Data Analysis and Visualization Tools**:
  - Access to statistical analysis software that is straightforward to navigate, with tools like Excel or simplified online data visualization services being sufficient for course requirements.

- **Machine Learning Frameworks**:
  - Utilization of software platforms that focus on pre-built models and simplified workflows, allowing students to engage with AI applications without the necessity of delving into complex coding.

### Scheduling Constraints
1. **Class Duration and Frequency**:
   - A class schedule that balances lecture content and hands-on practice should be established. One lab session per week is ideal for reinforcing learning through practical experience.

2. **TA Support Availability**:
   - Consideration must be given to TA support for facilitating interactive lab sessions or office hours, particularly since there is a focus on low-complexity tasks and discussions regarding data ethics.

### Facility Limitations
1. **Classroom Setup**:
   - Classrooms should be equipped with necessary technology for software demonstrations, including projection systems and reliable Wi-Fi connectivity.
   - Alternative spaces should be available for small group discussions, especially helpful when addressing ethical scenarios in smaller interactive formats.

### Summary of Suggestions and Adjustments
- The course design will need to avoid incorporating heavy programming fundamentals or complex ethical debates, focusing instead on practical data topics and simplified ethical considerations.
- The syllabus should introduce topics relevant to data types and their application in AI concisely, while ensuring transparency around institutional policies, particularly those specific to ASU.

### Final Considerations
- Continuous feedback mechanisms from students and ongoing monitoring of course delivery will be necessary for adjusting resource allocations and instructional materials as needed.
- Commitment to maintaining open lines of communication between faculty and administration is essential for adapting to potential adjustments, including TA support and lesson delivery refinement as required. An interactive and responsive learning environment will be crucial in meeting studentsâ€™ educational needs effectively.
