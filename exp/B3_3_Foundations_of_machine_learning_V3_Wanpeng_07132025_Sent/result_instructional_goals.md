Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

1. **Identify and Describe Data Types**: Students will identify various types of data (structured and unstructured) and explain their significance in AI applications.

2. **Explain Key Machine Learning Concepts**: Students will articulate fundamental machine learning concepts, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, using accessible language and minimal mathematical jargon.

3. **Analyze Data Relationships**: Students will demonstrate the ability to analyze relationships within data sets through visualization and low-complexity statistical techniques.

4. **Implement and Evaluate Basic Machine Learning Models**: Students will construct and evaluate simple machine learning models using data science platforms, aiming for a minimum acceptable model accuracy (e.g., 70% on predefined test cases).

5. **Explore Data Sources and Applications**: Students will investigate various data sources relevant to AI and apply them in developing data-driven solutions to real-world problems.

6. **Discuss Ethical Data Practices**: Students will summarize critical ethical considerations related to data use in AI, discussing contemporary issues like bias and privacy through specific case studies.
