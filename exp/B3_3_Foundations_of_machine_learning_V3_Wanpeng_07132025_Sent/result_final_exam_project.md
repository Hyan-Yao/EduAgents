# Final Project Plan Document

## Project Title: **Data-Driven Solutions: A Collaborative Machine Learning Initiative**

### Project Description:
The final project will engage students in addressing a real-world problem through the application of foundational machine learning concepts, critical thinking, and collaborative skills. Students will source data, apply machine learning models, and present findings, enhancing their understanding of AI and data practices.

### Learning Objectives:
1. Identify and Describe Data Types
2. Explain Key Machine Learning Concepts
3. Analyze Data Relationships
4. Implement and Evaluate Basic Machine Learning Models
5. Explore Data Sources and Applications
6. Discuss Ethical Data Practices
