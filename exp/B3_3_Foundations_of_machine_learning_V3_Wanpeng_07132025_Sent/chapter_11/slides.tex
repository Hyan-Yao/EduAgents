    \frametitle{Introduction to Data Ethics}
    \begin{block}{What is Data Ethics?}
        Data ethics is the branch of ethics examining the moral implications of data collection, processing, and use, particularly in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). 
        It focuses on how data is gathered, what data is used, and the potential impacts on individuals and society.
    \end{block}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Importance of Data Ethics in ML and AI}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Protection of Individuals} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Emphasizes privacy, consent, and security of personal information.
            \item Example: Predictive models using social media data require user consent and data anonymization.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Fairness and Bias Prevention} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Addresses biases that may be inherent in training data.
            \item Example: Hiring algorithms biased towards gender or race.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Accountability} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Clarifies who is responsible for AI-generated outcomes.
            \item Example: Liability in autonomous vehicle accidents.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Transparency} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Builds trust in AI systems by ensuring users understand decision-making processes.
            \item Example: Providing insight on credit scoring decisions enhances transparency.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Questions to Ponder}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How do we ensure data is collected and used ethically?
        \item In what ways can transparency in algorithms contribute to accountability?
        \item Can we truly eliminate bias from AI systems, and if so, how?
        \item What are the consequences of neglecting data ethics in today's digital age?
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Understanding Ethical Dilemmas}
    In the age of data-driven decision-making, ethical dilemmas frequently arise as we navigate the complexities of data usage. This presentation highlights two significant areas of concern: \textbf{Bias} and \textbf{Privacy}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts - Data Bias}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Bias occurs when data reflects and perpetuates prejudiced viewpoints, resulting in unfair treatment of certain groups.
        \item \textbf{Example:} 
        A hiring algorithm trained on historical data may favor male candidates if past records predominantly feature men in tech roles, thus disadvantaging qualified women.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts - Privacy Concerns}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Privacy issues revolve around the unauthorized access and use of personal data, potentially leading to breaches of individual confidentiality.
        \item \textbf{Example:} 
        Fitness tracking apps that collect and share users’ health data with third-party advertisers without informed consent raise significant ethical questions regarding user privacy.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{The Impact of Bias:} Algorithms can unintentionally reinforce societal inequalities. Understanding the source of bias is crucial in developing fair data practices.
        \item \textbf{Informed Consent:} Users must be aware of what data is being collected and how it will be used. Transparency is essential to maintain trust and uphold ethical standards.
        \item \textbf{Regulatory Frameworks:} Familiarity with regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) helps mitigate ethical concerns by enforcing strict data protection standards.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Thought-Provoking Questions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item How do we identify and mitigate bias in data collection and processing?
        \item What role does user education play in ensuring ethical data usage?
        \item Can algorithms ever be entirely free from bias? If not, what steps can we take to minimize its effects?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    Understanding and addressing ethical dilemmas in data usage—specifically bias and privacy—are fundamental to building trustworthy AI systems. As we move forward, it is imperative to engage with these concerns actively to ensure equitable outcomes for all stakeholders involved in data-driven decision-making.

    % Key Ethical Concerns Regarding COMPAS
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Bias in Outcomes:}
            - ProPublica's study (2016) showed significant bias against African American defendants.
            - Black individuals were often labeled as higher risk than white individuals, regardless of actual re-offending rates.

        \item \textbf{Transparency and Accountability:}
            - Proprietary algorithms limit scrutiny on risk score calculations.
            - Lack of transparency raises accountability concerns.

        \item \textbf{Impact on Communities:}
            - Misleading assessments can perpetuate cycles of disadvantage in marginalized communities.

        \item \textbf{Informed Consent:}
            - Limited understanding of COMPAS raises ethical questions about fairness in judicial processes.

    \frametitle{Case Study 3: Target's Predictive Analytics}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Target, a major US retailer, gained attention in 2012 for using predictive analytics to identify customers likely to be pregnant. This case showcases both the effectiveness and ethical implications of data analytics in marketing.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Predictive Analytics: What Is It?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Predictive analytics utilizes data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques.
        \item It identifies the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data.
        \item In Target's case, purchasing patterns were analyzed to infer potential pregnancy.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{How Target Did It}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Data Collection:} Used customer data from loyalty cards, analyzing purchases linked to pregnancy (e.g., prenatal vitamins).
        \item \textbf{Pattern Recognition:} Developed a predictive model scoring customers based on their pregnancy likelihood.
        \item \textbf{Targeted Marketing:} Sent personalized materials to identified customers, focusing on baby products.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Concerns}
    \begin{block}{Privacy}
        Many customers were unaware of the depth of scrutiny regarding their shopping habits. Should such personal data be used without explicit consent?
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Surprise and Disclosure}
        Customers receiving pregnancy-related marketing materials were often startled, especially if they did not disclose this information publicly. What should companies disclose about data usage?
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Discrimination}
        The method could lead to disproportionate targeting of specific demographics, raising concerns about ethical segmentation of consumers.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Target's case illustrates predictive analytics as a double-edged sword: driving success vs. risking trust.
        \item Highlights the need for ethical guidelines in data usage.
        \item Emphasizes responsible data practices prioritizing consumer consent and transparency.
    \end{itemize}
