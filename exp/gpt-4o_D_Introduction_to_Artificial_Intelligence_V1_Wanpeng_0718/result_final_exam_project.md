# Final Project Plan: AI Solutions for Real-World Challenges

## Project Description
In this final project, students will work in teams or individually to identify a real-world challenge that can be addressed with an AI-driven solution. The project encourages students to apply theories, engage in critical thinking, and consider ethical implications of their chosen technology. The output will include both a technical report and a presentation that summarize their solution and its societal impacts.

## Objectives
1. Apply AI techniques to a real-world challenge.
2. Evaluate ethical considerations and societal impacts of proposed solutions.
3. Demonstrate technical proficiency with AI tools by developing complete project deliverables.
4. Collaboratively present findings and receive feedback.
