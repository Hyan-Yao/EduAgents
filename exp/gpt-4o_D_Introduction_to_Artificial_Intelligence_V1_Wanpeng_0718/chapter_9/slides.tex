    \frametitle{Introduction to Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{What is Reinforcement Learning?}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions, guiding it towards optimal behavior over time.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Definitions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Agent}: The learner or decision maker (e.g., a robot, software program).
        \item \textbf{Environment}: The external system with which the agent interacts (e.g., a game, real-world scenario).
        \item \textbf{Action (A)}: The set of choices available to the agent.
        \item \textbf{State (S)}: The current situation of the agent within the environment.
        \item \textbf{Reward (R)}: A feedback signal received from the environment after taking an action, indicating the success or failure of that action.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{How Reinforcement Learning Works}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation}: The agent must balance between exploring new actions to discover their effects (exploration) and leveraging known actions that yield high rewards (exploitation).
        \item \textbf{Learning Process}: The agent's goal is to maximize cumulative rewards over time, typically using a policy (a strategy for action selection) and a value function (which estimates the goodness of being in a given state).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Importance of Reinforcement Learning in AI}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Autonomous Learning}: RL enables systems to learn from interactions in real-time, adapting to new situations without pre-programmed instructions.
        \item \textbf{Real-World Applications}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Robotics}: Learning to perform complex tasks like grasping objects or navigating spaces.
            \item \textbf{Game Playing}: Algorithms like AlphaGo achieving superhuman performance in strategic games.
            \item \textbf{Healthcare}: Optimizing treatment plans based on patient interactions and outcomes.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item RL focuses on learning from past actions to drive future behavior.
        \item Feedback signals are pivotal: positive rewards reinforce behavior, while negative rewards discourage it.
        \item RL differs from supervised learning; the learning process is based on the agentâ€™s actions and outcomes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Illustrative Example}
    \begin{block}{Robot Learning in a Maze}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{State}: The robot's current position in the maze.
            \item \textbf{Action}: Move forward, turn left, or turn right.
            \item \textbf{Reward}: Positive when the robot reaches the object; negative if it hits a wall.
        \end{itemize}
        Over time, with numerous trials, the robot will learn the most efficient path to the objects, forming a learned policy based on successful actions.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Q-Learning Formula}
    The Q-Learning algorithm, a popular RL method, can be represented mathematically as follows:

    \begin{equation}
        Q(s, a) \gets Q(s, a) + \alpha[R + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
    \end{equation}

    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( Q(s, a) \): Estimated value of action \( a \) in state \( s \).
        \item \( \alpha \): Learning rate (controls how much new information overrides old).
        \item \( R \): Reward received after taking action \( a \).
        \item \( \gamma \): Discount factor (how much future rewards are valued).
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Understanding the historical context of RL is key to appreciating its present and future influence in various sectors.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts of Reinforcement Learning - Agent}
    \begin{block}{1. Agent}
        \textbf{Definition:} An agent is an entity that interacts with the environment to achieve a certain goal. It can be a software algorithm, a robot, or any decision-making system.
    \end{block}
    \begin{example} 
        \textbf{Example:} Think of a self-driving car. The car (agent) must navigate a city (environment) while obeying traffic laws and ensuring passenger safety.
    \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts of Reinforcement Learning - Environment and Actions}
    \begin{block}{2. Environment}
        \textbf{Definition:} The environment is everything that the agent interacts with, consisting of states and dynamics that define how actions lead to new states.
    \end{block}
    \begin{example}
        \textbf{Example:} In the context of the self-driving car, the environment includes the road, traffic signals, pedestrians, other vehicles, and weather conditions.
    \end{example}
    
    \begin{block}{3. Actions}
        \textbf{Definition:} Actions are the choices available to the agent that change the state of the environment. 
    \end{block}
    \begin{example}
        \textbf{Example:} For the self-driving car, possible actions include accelerating, braking, turning left, or turning right.
    \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts of Reinforcement Learning - Rewards and Policies}
    \begin{block}{4. Rewards}
        \textbf{Definition:} Rewards are feedback signals provided to the agent after executing an action, quantifying how beneficial that action was in achieving the agent's goal.
    \end{block}
    \begin{example}
        \textbf{Example:} If the car successfully navigates through a green light, it receives a positive reward; if it runs a red light, it receives a negative reward (penalty).
    \end{example}
    
    \begin{block}{5. Policy}
        \textbf{Definition:} A policy is a strategy employed by the agent to determine actions based on the current state of the environment. It can be deterministic or stochastic.
    \end{block}
    \begin{example}
        \textbf{Example:} A deterministic policy states that if the lights are green, the car will always accelerate; a stochastic policy may suggest random choices based on probabilities.
    \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts of Reinforcement Learning - Key Points and Illustrative Formula}
    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reinforcement learning revolves around the interaction between agent and environment, with the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards through optimal policies.
            \item Each concept is interdependent; changes in one can significantly impact the others.
            \item An agent's ability to learn from interactions and improve its policy over time is what makes reinforcement learning powerful.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Cumulative Reward Calculation}
        \begin{equation}
        G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \ldots
        \end{equation}
        where \( G_t \) is the total reward from time \( t \), \( R \) is the reward received at time \( t \), and \( \gamma \) (0 â‰¤ \(\gamma\) < 1) is the discount factor.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Overview of Common Algorithms}
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms enable agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions in an environment. In this presentation, we will discuss three prominent algorithms:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Q-learning
        \item SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
        \item Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Q-learning}
    \begin{block}{What is Q-learning?}
        Q-learning is an off-policy RL algorithm that learns the value of an action in a particular state. It uses a Q-table to store value estimates, where each entry represents the expected utility of taking a specific action in a specific state.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Formula}
        \begin{equation}
        Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Use Case:} Autonomous agents in simple environments (e.g., grid-based games) to maximize rewards.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{2. SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)}
    \begin{block}{What is SARSA?}
        SARSA is an on-policy RL algorithm that updates its policy based on the current action taken. It evaluates actions as it learns, updating the Q-values based on the action actually taken.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Formula}
        \begin{equation}
        Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Use Case:} Environments where the policy needs to be updated continuously, such as robotic control where safety is crucial.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{3. Deep Q-Networks (DQN)}
    \begin{block}{What is DQN?}
        DQN extends Q-learning by using neural networks to approximate the Q-value function, enabling it to handle high-dimensional state spaces.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Features}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Experience Replay:} Uses a memory buffer to store past experiences, which are randomly sampled during training to reduce correlation between samples.
            \item \textbf{Fixed Q-targets:} Involves a separate target network to stabilize learning by updating the target network less frequently.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Use Case:} Successful in complex environments like video games (e.g., Atari), where state space is vast and actions are numerous.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points and Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Q-learning:} Off-policy and value-based; simple to implement in discrete environments.
        \item \textbf{SARSA:} On-policy and adapts to the policy being followed; useful in dynamic, uncertain environments.
        \item \textbf{DQN:} Combines RL with deep learning; powerful for handling high-dimensional inputs.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Summary:} 
    Reinforcement Learning algorithms provide varied approaches to learn optimal policies across diverse environments. Understanding their differences and applications paves the way for effectively utilizing RL in real-world scenarios.

    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations in Reinforcement Learning}
    % Discussion of the ethical implications, including biases, fairness, and transparency in reinforcement learning systems.
    \begin{block}{Introduction to Ethics in AI}
        Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly applied across industries, raising important ethical questions that need to be addressed to ensure trust, accountability, and fairness in AI systems. Three major ethical considerations are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Biases
            \item Fairness
            \item Transparency
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Biases in Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Bias in AI refers to systematic favoritism or prejudice within algorithms that leads to unfair outcomes.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Origin of Bias}
        Bias can be introduced through:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Training data that isn't representative of all user demographics.
            \item The design of reward structures that may favor certain actions unfairly.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        An RL model trained to optimize a delivery route may systematically prioritize affluent neighborhoods over lower-income areas, potentially leading to unequal service delivery.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Fairness in Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Fairness ensures that all individuals or groups receive equitable treatment and outcomes from AI systems.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Types of Fairness}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Individual Fairness: Similar individuals should receive similar outcomes.
            \item Group Fairness: Different groups should receive equitable outcomes.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Fairness can be quantitatively assessed using metrics such as Equal Opportunity and Demographic Parity.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        A healthcare RL application may prioritize treatment options based on patient characteristics, which, if not handled carefully, could perpetuate health disparities among racial or socioeconomic groups.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Transparency in Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Transparency involves making the workings of RL systems understandable to users and stakeholders.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Importance}
        High transparency can foster trust and accountability among users.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Methods such as interpretable models or providing explanations for the actions taken by RL agents can enhance transparency.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In autonomous vehicles using RL for navigation, it is crucial to clearly explain why a certain route was chosen or why it made specific driving decisions to both users and regulatory bodies.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Conclusion and Additional Resources}
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Addressing the ethical considerations of biases, fairness, and transparency is essential for the responsible deployment of reinforcement learning technologies. Integrating ethical frameworks into the design and application of RL can help mitigate risks and enhance societal trust in AI systems.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Additional Resources}
