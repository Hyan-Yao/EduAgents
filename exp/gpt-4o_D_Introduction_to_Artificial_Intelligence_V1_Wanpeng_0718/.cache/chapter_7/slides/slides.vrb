\frametitle{Key Algorithms in Supervised Learning - Decision Trees}

    \begin{block}{Concept}
        A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like structure where nodes represent features, branches represent decision rules, and each leaf node represents an outcome.

    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a credit approval scenario, a Decision Tree might ask:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Is the applicant's income above $50,000?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Yes: Move to next question
                \item No: Decline
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Easy to interpret and visualize
        \item Can handle both numerical and categorical data
        \item Prone to overfitting if not pruned
    \end{itemize}
