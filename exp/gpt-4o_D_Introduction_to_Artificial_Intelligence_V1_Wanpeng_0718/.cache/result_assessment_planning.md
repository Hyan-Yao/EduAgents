### Question Types within Assessments
- **Open-ended Questions** in quizzes and reflection papers to encourage critical thinking and application of learned concepts.
- **Multiple Choice Questions** in weekly quizzes to assess recall of terminology and historical milestones in AI.

### Grading Rubrics
- Clear criteria based on the depth of analysis, application of knowledge, creativity, and presentation skills will be provided for each project component with point allocations reflecting the importance of each criterion. Each component will have a rubric detailing expectations for different grade levels (e.g., exemplary, satisfactory, needs improvement).

## Conclusion
This assessment plan not only assesses students’ knowledge and skills in artificial intelligence but also develops their ability to think critically and ethically about technologies and their implications in the real world. Through project-based assessments, students will experience realistic challenges faced in AI and be encouraged to pursue innovative solutions. Regular feedback throughout the course will support their learning journey and enhance their engagement with key concepts.
