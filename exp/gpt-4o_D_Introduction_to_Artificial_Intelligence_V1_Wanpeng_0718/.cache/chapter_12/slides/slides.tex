    \frametitle{Introduction to Ethical Considerations in AI}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        In today's rapidly advancing technological landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems play a crucial role in various sectors, from healthcare to finance. However, ethical considerations, particularly regarding \textbf{bias} and \textbf{fairness}, have become critical.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Why Ethics in AI Matters}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Impact on Society}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item AI applications affect millions of lives daily. Decisions made by AI can influence hiring, lending, criminal justice, and more.
                \item Biased AI can lead to unfair treatment of individuals based on race, gender, age, or other characteristics.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Trust and Adoption}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Users must trust that AI systems are fair and unbiased to adopt them. Trust is fundamental for the broader acceptance of AI technologies.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Legal and Regulatory Compliance}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Many jurisdictions are enacting laws to regulate AI, focusing on bias and discrimination. Companies must comply with these regulations to avoid penalties and foster accountability.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts in AI Ethics}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Bias}: Refers to systematic unfairness in decisions made by AI systems, often arising from the data they are trained on, the algorithms they employ, or human prejudices influencing their design.
        \item \textbf{Fairness}: The principle that all individuals should be treated equally by AI systems, ensuring that factors such as race or gender do not unjustly affect outcomes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Real-world Examples of AI Bias}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Hiring Algorithms}: AI-based recruitment tools may favor candidates from certain demographics if trained on skewed historical data. For instance, a tool trained primarily on resumes from a specific gender may not perform well for diverse applicants.
        \item \textbf{Facial Recognition}: Studies indicate that facial recognition systems exhibit higher error rates for people of color compared to white individuals. This can lead to wrongful identifications and reinforce societal biases.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Remember}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bias and fairness in AI are not just technical concerns; they have ethical, social, and legal implications.
        \item Addressing bias involves continuous monitoring, evaluation, and improvement of AI systems.
        \item Developers and organizations must prioritize ethical considerations throughout the AI development lifecycle.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    As we delve deeper into the intricacies of bias and fairness in AI, it is essential to cultivate a mindset focused on ethical responsibility. By consciously addressing these issues, we can advance the development and deployment of AI technologies that are just, fair, and beneficial for all.

    \frametitle{Fairness in AI - Introduction}
    \begin{block}{Introduction to Fairness in AI}
        Fairness in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a critical concern as AI systems increasingly impact decision-making across various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. 
        The concept of fairness addresses the need for AI systems to treat individuals and groups equitably, free from bias and discrimination.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Fairness in AI - Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Fairness Definitions}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Individual Fairness}: Similar individuals should receive similar outcomes.
            \item \textbf{Group Fairness}: Demographic groups (e.g., race, gender) should receive similar treatment or outcomes.
            \item \textbf{Counterfactual Fairness}: Outcomes should remain the same if a sensitive attribute (e.g., race) were altered.
        \end{enumerate}
        
        \item \textbf{Fairness Metrics}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Demographic Parity}: Ensures a similar proportion of positive outcomes across different demographic groups.
            \item \textbf{Equal Opportunity}: Focuses on providing equal true positive rates among groups.
            \item \textbf{Predictive Parity}: Ensures that predictive accuracy is uniform across different groups.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Fairness in AI - Example}
    \begin{block}{Illustrative Example}
        Consider a job recruitment AI that evaluates candidates based on certain metrics:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If the AI places \textbf{30\% of male candidates} into the "interview" category and only \textbf{10\% of female candidates}, this shows a potential bias. 
            \item Applying \textbf{Demographic Parity} metrics would prompt a review of the model to ensure similar rates of positive outcomes between genders.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Fairness in AI - Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Importance of Fairness}: Ensures trust in AI systems and upholds social justice principles.
        \item \textbf{Trade-offs in Metrics}: Achieving fairness often involves trade-offs between different metrics (e.g., optimizing for demographic parity may affect overall accuracy).
        \item \textbf{Space for Subjectivity}: Definitions of fairness may vary based on societal norms and contexts, necessitating careful consideration of what fairness means in different scenarios.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Fairness in AI - Notable Formulas}
    \begin{block}{Formulas}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Demographic Parity Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Demographic Parity} = \frac{P(Y=1|A=0)}{P(Y=1|A=1)}
            \end{equation}
            Where \( Y \) is the outcome variable, and \( A \) is the sensitive attribute.

            \item \textbf{True Positive Rate} (Equal Opportunity):
            \begin{equation}
                \text{TPR} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}
            \end{equation}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
