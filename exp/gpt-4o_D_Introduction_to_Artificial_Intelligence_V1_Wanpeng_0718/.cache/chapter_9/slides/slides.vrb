\frametitle{Key Concepts of Reinforcement Learning - Key Points and Illustrative Formula}
    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reinforcement learning revolves around the interaction between agent and environment, with the goal of maximizing cumulative rewards through optimal policies.
            \item Each concept is interdependent; changes in one can significantly impact the others.
            \item An agent's ability to learn from interactions and improve its policy over time is what makes reinforcement learning powerful.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Cumulative Reward Calculation}
        \begin{equation}
        G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \ldots
        \end{equation}
        where \( G_t \) is the total reward from time \( t \), \( R \) is the reward received at time \( t \), and \( \gamma \) (0 â‰¤ \(\gamma\) < 1) is the discount factor.
    \end{block}
