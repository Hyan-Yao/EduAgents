\frametitle{Conclusion and Forward Look - Final Thoughts}
    AI is a transformative shift in our interaction with the world. Understanding its history allows us to anticipate future developments and address challenges. The journey of AI has just begun, inviting both excitement and responsibility as we enter a new technological era.

    \textbf{Example Model in AI:}
    Consider the following simple linear regression model used in machine learning:
    \begin{equation}
        y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon
    \end{equation}
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(y\) is the dependent variable (outcome),
        \item \(\beta_0\) is the y-intercept,
        \item \(\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n\) are coefficients for the independent variables,
        \item \(\epsilon\) represents the error term.
    \end{itemize}

    This formula illustrates how AI employs statistical methods for predictions across various fields.
