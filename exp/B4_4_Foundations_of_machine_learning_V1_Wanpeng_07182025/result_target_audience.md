### 2) Data-driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Introductory Module:**
   - Introduce a basic review session focusing on essential machine learning terminologies and concepts to ensure a common understanding among students.

2. **Tool Workshops:**
   - Schedule hands-on workshops specifically for Google Colab and Scikit-learn, allowing students to practice and enhance their proficiency in these critical tools.

3. **Differentiated Learning Materials:**
   - Create a range of instructional materials catering to various learning styles, including videos, written guides, and interactive tools to support diverse student needs.

4. **Adaptive Pacing:**
   - Modify the pacing of lectures based on student feedback, especially in the early weeks when foundational concepts are introduced, ensuring all students keep up.

5. **Continuous Feedback Loop:**
   - Implement regular formative assessments, reflections, and open feedback sessions to gauge student understanding and allow for adaptive teaching methods throughout the course duration.

By integrating these recommendations, the course can better address the knowledge gaps and diverse learning needs of the students, fostering a supportive environment that enhances engagement and mastery in machine learning.
