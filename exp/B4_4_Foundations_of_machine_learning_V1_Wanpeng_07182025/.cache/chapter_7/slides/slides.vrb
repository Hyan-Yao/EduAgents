        \begin{itemize}
            \item Agent observes the state of the environment.
            \item Agent decides on an action based on its policy.
            \item Agent performs the action.
            \item The environment provides a reward and updates its state.
            \item This feedback loop continues as the agent refines its policy.
        \end{itemize}
