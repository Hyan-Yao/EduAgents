\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts: Prioritization}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Prioritization:**
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Use the Eisenhower Matrix to identify tasks based on urgency and importance:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item **Urgent and Important:** Do these tasks first.

    \frametitle{Conclusion of Fall Break - Overview}
    As we conclude our Fall Break, it’s vital to reflect on the importance of balance between studying and taking breaks. This balance is crucial not only for academic success but also for mental and emotional health.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Balancing Study with Breaks}
    \begin{block}{The Importance of Breaks}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Restores Energy:} Continuous studying can lead to fatigue. Breaks help rejuvenate your mind and body, making you more productive.
            \item \textbf{Enhances Creativity:} Taking time away from academic pressures fosters creativity. Engaging in leisure activities can lead to new ideas and perspectives.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Pomodoro Technique}
        Study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After 4 sessions, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). This method can maximize focus and allow for rejuvenation.
        
        \begin{equation}
        \text{Work Interval} + \text{Short Break} + \text{Long Break}
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Practical Examples}
    \begin{block}{Utilizing Breaks Effectively}

            \item \textbf{Socializing:} Use breaks to connect with friends or family, either virtually or in person, to share experiences and unwind.
            \item \textbf{Physical Activity:} Engage in quick workouts, such as a brisk walk or yoga, to improve mood and energy levels.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Incorporating breaks into your study routine is not just beneficial; it's essential. Maintaining a balanced schedule enhances both your academic performance and well-being.
