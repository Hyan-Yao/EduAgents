---

**Frame 1: Overview**

Let’s delve into our Peer Feedback Session. At its core, peer feedback is an essential aspect of the learning journey, especially during presentations. It acts as a tool that fosters constructive conversation among peers. Think about it: when we receive feedback, we're not just getting criticism; we're being given a pathway to improvement. 

Constructive feedback helps us to see our work through different lenses. It allows us to refine our skills, gain new perspectives, and ultimately elevate the quality of our projects. Today, we will explore how to effectively provide and receive this feedback. By the end of this session, you will feel more confident navigating the peer feedback process.

**[Transition to Frame 2]**

---

**Frame 2: Process for Providing Constructive Feedback**

Now, let’s look specifically at how we can provide constructive feedback to our peers. One of the first techniques I want to highlight is to **be specific**. When you give feedback, it’s important to move beyond vague phrases like, "Great job!" Instead, specify what truly resonated with you. For example, you might say, "Your introduction clearly outlined the objectives, which really helped focus the audience's attention." By being precise, you provide actionable advice that your peer can appreciate and utilize.

Next, we have something known as the **"sandwich" technique**. This is a popular method in educational settings. It involves starting your feedback with a positive comment, then presenting an area for improvement, and finally concluding with another positive note. For instance, you could say, "I loved your visuals; they were really engaging. However, I suggest simplifying your data a bit to enhance clarity. Overall, your enthusiasm made the presentation enjoyable!" This not only makes the feedback easier to accept but also maintains a positive atmosphere.

Another crucial point is to **focus on the work, not the person**. Feedback should always center on the project aspects rather than making personal judgments. For example, instead of saying, "You didn't explain your argument well," frame your feedback by saying, "The argument was compelling, but the logic could be tighter." This shift in language helps maintain a constructive environment.

Finally, it's important to **encourage questions** during the feedback process. Open-ended questions can stimulate deeper discussion. You might ask, "What was your thought process in developing this part?" This not only shows interest in their work but also encourages a more enriching dialogue.

**[Transition to Frame 3]**

---

**Frame 3: Process for Receiving Feedback**

Now let’s pivot to how you, as a presenter, can receive feedback effectively. Firstly, **be open-minded**. It's vital to approach feedback with a mindset geared towards growth. Remember, this is not about criticism; it’s about improvement. 

Next is the importance of **listening actively**. When receiving feedback, ensure that you are fully present. Acknowledge what your peer is sharing without interrupting or feeling defensive. It's beneficial to take notes too; this way, you won’t miss valuable insights.

If at any point the feedback feels unclear, don’t hesitate to **ask for clarification**. Engage your peer by asking for specific examples. For instance, if someone mentions "unclear reasoning," you might say, "Can you explain what you mean by unclear reasoning?" This not only shows your willingness to learn but also ensures you grasp their perspective more clearly.

After the session, **reflect on the feedback** you’ve received. Give yourself time to assess which points resonate with you and consider how you can incorporate them into your work. 

And don’t forget to **express gratitude**. Thank your peers for their insights, whether you agree with their points or not. Recognizing their time and effort fosters a positive and supportive learning atmosphere.

**[Transition to Frame 4]**

**Frame 4: Example Scenario**

To illustrate these concepts, let’s examine an example scenario. Imagine that you’ve just presented a marketing project. A peer points out that while your market analysis was impressive and thorough, your presentation could significantly benefit from a clearer call-to-action. Additionally, they compliment your detailed data findings, suggest simplifying your slides for increased clarity, and encourage you to include a summary slide to emphasize key points.

The key here is taking this feedback as an opportunity for growth. Rather than feeling disheartened by the critique, embrace it positively.  How can you use these suggestions to enhance your future presentations? 

**[Conclusion]**

Mastering the processes of giving and receiving feedback doesn’t just enrich your current project; it also cultivates critical communication and analytical skills that are essential in both your academic and professional journeys. As we conclude this session, think about how you can implement these strategies in your approach to feedback.
