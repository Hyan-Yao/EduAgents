**Question 1:** What is one potential future direction for supervised learning?

  A) Reducing data collection
  B) Integrating more unsupervised techniques
  C) Relying solely on traditional statistical methods
  D) Minimizing model complexities

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Future directions may include the integration of unsupervised techniques to create hybrid models.

**Question 2:** Which algorithm is primarily used for binary classification?

  A) Linear Regression
  B) Logistic Regression
  C) Decision Trees
  D) Support Vector Machines

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Logistic regression is specifically designed for binary classification tasks.

**Question 3:** What is a critical model evaluation metric for imbalanced datasets?

  A) Accuracy
  B) Mean Squared Error
  C) Precision and Recall
  D) R-squared

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Precision and recall are especially important for assessing performance on imbalanced datasets, where accuracy may be misleading.

**Question 4:** What is the relationship between model complexity and interpretability?

  A) More complex models are always more interpretable
  B) Simpler models tend to be more interpretable
  C) Complexity has no impact on interpretability
  D) All complex models are not interpretable

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Generally, simpler models are easier to understand and interpret than more complex models.
