Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

1. **Objective 1: Application of Techniques**  
   Students will be able to apply key machine learning techniques, including classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and neural networks, to solve problems related to healthcare, finance, or social media analysis.

2. **Objective 2: Model Performance Evaluation**  
   Students will be equipped to evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning models on specified datasets using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

3. **Objective 3: Data Preprocessing and Analysis**  
   Students will demonstrate the ability to preprocess and analyze data effectively for machine learning tasks, including cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering to enhance model performance.

4. **Objective 4: Ethical Considerations in ML**  
   Students will understand and articulate the ethical considerations and limitations involved in the application of machine learning methods, recognizing the implications of bias, transparency, and accountability in model deployment, including relevant legal frameworks and case studies.

5. **Objective 5: Collaborative Project Work**  
   Students will collaboratively design and implement a machine learning solution, integrating best practices in model evaluation and ethical considerations, and present their findings effectively in a group setting.

6. **Objective 6: Iterative Model Improvement**  
   Students will develop the ability to iteratively improve machine learning models based on performance metrics and peer feedback, enhancing their skills in model refinement and optimization.
