  \frametitle{Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Definition}: RL is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
    \item \textbf{Components}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Agent}: The learner or decision-maker.
        \item \textbf{Environment}: Everything the agent interacts with.
        \item \textbf{Actions}: Choices made by the agent to influence its state.
        \item \textbf{State}: Representation of the current situation of the agent.
        \item \textbf{Reward}: Feedback from the environment based on the action taken.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Example of Reinforcement Learning}
  Consider a robot learning to navigate a maze:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{States}: Positions within the maze.
    \item \textbf{Actions}: Move up, down, left, or right.
    \item \textbf{Rewards}: Positive reward for reaching the exit, negative reward for hitting walls.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  The robot explores paths, learning which actions lead to the highest cumulative rewards.
