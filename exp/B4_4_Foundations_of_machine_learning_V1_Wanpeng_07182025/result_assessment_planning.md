### Assessment Components

1. **Weekly Assignments (30%)**
   - **Format**: Practical exercises (individual), submitted via Canvas in .ipynb.
   - **Description**: Apply concepts from lectures through hands-on coding tasks focused on data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation metrics.
   - **Timing**: Weekly, every Monday.
   - **Grading Rubric**:
     - Correctness of code (50%)
     - Clarity of explanations and comments (20%)
     - Depth of analysis (30%)

2. **Midterm Project (25%)**
   - **Format**: Group project, report in PDF and code in .ipynb, submitted via Canvas.
   - **Description**: Teams of 4-5 students will select a dataset from healthcare, finance, or social media to develop a supervised learning model and prepare a report.
   - **Milestones**:
     - **Proposal Submission** (Week 5)
     - **Progress Report** (Week 8)
   - **Grading Rubric**:
     - Quality of analysis and methodology (40%)
     - Team collaboration and individual contributions (30%)
     - Presentation of results (20%)
     - Ethical considerations and reflections (10%)

3. **Final Project (30%)**
   - **Format**: Individual or group project (same team as midterm), report in PDF and code in .ipynb, submitted via Canvas.
   - **Description**: Expand the midterm project by refining models, implementing new techniques, and considering ethical implications. Includes in-class presentations for peer evaluation.
   - **Milestones**:
     - **Project Proposal** (Week 10)
     - **Midway Checkpoint Presentation** (Week 13)
     - **Final Submission** (Week 15)
   - **Grading Rubric**:
     - Innovation in approach/technique (30%)
     - Depth of analysis and model performance (30%)
     - Ethical discussion and implications (20%)
     - Quality of presentation (20%)
  
4. **Class Participation (15%)**
   - **Format**: Reflective journals submitted weekly, in .pdf.
   - **Description**: Submit reflections on learning experiences, challenges faced, and resolutions after each class.
   - **Grading Rubric**:
     - Engagement with course material (50%)
     - Reflection depth (30%)
     - Timeliness of submissions (20%)
