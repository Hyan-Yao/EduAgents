**Question 2:** Which of the following techniques is used for clustering?

  A) Principal Component Analysis
  B) K-means Clustering
  C) Linear Regression
  D) Gradient Descent

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** K-means Clustering is a common unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together.

**Question 3:** What does the Silhouette Score measure in unsupervised learning?

  A) The performance of a supervised model
  B) The compactness of clusters compared to others
  C) The accuracy of labels in the dataset
  D) The processing speed of the algorithm

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The Silhouette Score is a metric used to evaluate how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.

**Question 4:** Why is unsupervised learning becoming increasingly important?

  A) It helps in making predictions for labeled datasets.
  B) Data is growing in volume and complexity, making manual labeling impractical.
  C) It is only useful in theoretical applications.
  D) All algorithms require labeled datasets for performance.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** As data continues to grow in volume and complexity, unsupervised learning allows for insights without relying on manually labeled datasets.
