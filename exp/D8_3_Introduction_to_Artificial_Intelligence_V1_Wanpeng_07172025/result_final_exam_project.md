# Final Project Plan: Capstone AI Solution Development

## Project Description
The capstone project will serve as a comprehensive final assessment for the course "D8_3: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence." Students will collaboratively develop an AI solution that addresses a real-world problem, while adhering to ethical considerations in AI development.

## Objectives
1. Understanding key concepts in AI principles and technologies.
2. Application of AI techniques using Python and relevant frameworks.
3. Critical evaluation of the societal impact of the developed solution.
4. Effective data handling and management.
5. Exploration of ethical considerations in AI development.
6. Collaboration in teams and effective communication of project findings.
7. Researching emerging AI trends relevant to the project problem.

## Submission Formats
- **Reports**: Submit in PDF format.
- **Presentation Slides**: Submit in PDF format.
- **Computational Aspects**: Submit Jupyter Notebook files for any computational components.
- **Canvas LMS Compatibility**: All submissions facilitated through Canvas.

## Academic Integrity Guidelines
- All students must adhere to the academic integrity policy.
- Written submissions will undergo plagiarism detection through software (e.g., Turnitin).
- Students will reflect on their collaboration and document contributions in the reflective journal to promote accountability. 

## Conclusion
This capstone project will not only evaluate students' understanding of AI concepts but also enhance their ability to apply knowledge practically and ethically. The structured milestones, collaboration, and focus on ethical implications will equip students with the necessary skills for real-world applications of AI technologies.
