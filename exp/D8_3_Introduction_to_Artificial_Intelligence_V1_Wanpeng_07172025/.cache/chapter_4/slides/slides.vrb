\frametitle{2. Parsing}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Parsing is the process of analyzing a string of symbols (typically sentences in NLP) to determine its structure according to the grammar of the language. It helps in extracting the grammatical relationships between words.

    \begin{block}{Example}
        Consider the sentence “The cat sat on the mat.” A simple parse tree may look like this:
        \begin{lstlisting}
          Sentence
           ├── NP (Noun Phrase)
           │    ├── Determiner: The
           │    └── Noun: cat
           ├── Verb: sat
           └── PP (Prepositional Phrase)
                ├── Preposition: on
                └── NP
                     ├── Determiner: the
                     └── Noun: mat
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Parsing is crucial for understanding the relationships and hierarchical structure within sentences, enabling better interpretation of meaning.
