\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Key Concepts in NLP}
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an important area within AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This presentation will cover foundational concepts essential to NLP:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Tokenization
        \item Parsing
        \item Semantic Understanding
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Tokenization}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, known as tokens. Tokens can be words, phrases, or symbols, depending on the granularity required.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        For the sentence “I love Natural Language Processing,” tokenization might yield:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Word-level tokens: [“I”, “love”, “Natural”, “Language”, “Processing”]
            \item Sentence-level tokens: [“I love Natural Language Processing.”, “This is an example sentence.”]
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Tokenization is essential as it transforms raw text into a format that can be analyzed and processed by algorithms.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{2. Parsing}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Parsing is the process of analyzing a string of symbols (typically sentences in NLP) to determine its structure according to the grammar of the language. It helps in extracting the grammatical relationships between words.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Consider the sentence “The cat sat on the mat.” A simple parse tree may look like this:
        \begin{lstlisting}
          Sentence
           ├── NP (Noun Phrase)
           │    ├── Determiner: The
           │    └── Noun: cat
           ├── Verb: sat
           └── PP (Prepositional Phrase)
                ├── Preposition: on
                └── NP
                     ├── Determiner: the
                     └── Noun: mat
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Parsing is crucial for understanding the relationships and hierarchical structure within sentences, enabling better interpretation of meaning.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{3. Semantic Understanding}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Semantic understanding involves grasping the meaning of words and sentences in context. This step goes beyond basic grammatical analysis to comprehend concepts and intents conveyed by the text.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        The word "bank" can mean the side of a river or a financial institution. Context helps to discern the correct meaning when used in a sentence.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Effective semantic understanding is vital for applications like machine translation, chatbots, and sentiment analysis since it ensures that the intended message is correctly interpreted.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    These key concepts—tokenization, parsing, and semantic understanding—serve as the building blocks for more advanced NLP applications. Understanding these principles lays the groundwork for exploring techniques such as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bag-of-words
        \item Word embeddings
        \item Neural networks
    \end{itemize}
    These topics will be discussed in the next slide. 

    \begin{block}{Additional Note}
        While coding and computation are integral to NLP, the principles of language understanding and processing are crucial for successfully implementing these techniques.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{NLP Techniques - Overview}
  % Brief overview of NLP techniques
  Natural Language Processing (NLP) encompasses various techniques that enable machines to understand and manipulate human language. In this slide, we will discuss three foundational NLP techniques:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bag-of-Words (BoW)}
    \item \textbf{Word Embeddings}
    \item \textbf{Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{NLP Techniques - Bag-of-Words}
  % Discussion of Bag-of-Words
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    The Bag-of-Words model treats each document as a bag (multiset) of words, ignoring grammar and word order but keeping track of word frequencies.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{How it Works}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Tokenize text into individual words.
      \item Create a vocabulary listing all unique words.
      \item Convert each document into a vector based on word counts.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Example}
    For the sentences:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item ``I love NLP.''
      \item ``NLP is fascinating.''
    \end{itemize}
    The vocabulary will be: ``\{I, love, NLP, is, fascinating\}''.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item ``I love NLP.'' → [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
      \item ``NLP is fascinating.'' → [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Easy to implement and interpret.
      \item Does not capture context or meaning, leading to potential loss of information.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{NLP Techniques - Word Embeddings}
  % Discussion of Word Embeddings
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    Word Embeddings are dense vector representations of words, capturing their meanings based on context rather than mere frequencies.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{How it Works}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Each word is transformed into a high-dimensional vector.
      \item Words with similar meanings are located close to each other in vector space.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Common Algorithms}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Word2Vec
      \item GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Example}
    In a vector space, the words may be represented as:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item king → [0.5, 0.2, ...],
      \item queen → [0.4, 0.3, ...],
      \item man → [0.6, 0.1, ...],
      \item woman → [0.5, 0.2, ...]
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Captures semantic relationships (e.g., ``king'' - ``man'' + ``woman'' ≈ ``queen'').
      \item More effective for machine learning tasks due to contextual richness.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{NLP Techniques - Recurrent Neural Networks}
  % Discussion of Recurrent Neural Networks
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    RNNs are a class of neural networks designed for processing sequences of data, making them especially useful for tasks in NLP.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{How it Works}
    RNNs maintain a hidden state that captures information about previous inputs, enabling them to understand context and dependencies in sequences.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Key Features}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Suitable for variable-length input sequences (e.g., sentences).
      \item Enhanced with LSTMs and GRUs to better handle long-range dependencies.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Example Structure}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN

model = Sequential()
model.add(SimpleRNN(units=10, input_shape=(None, num_features)))
    \end{lstlisting}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Excel in language modeling, machine translation, and speech recognition.
      \item Prone to gradient vanishing/exploding problems, mitigated by LSTMs/GRUs.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
