  \frametitle{Identifying Biases in AI}
  \begin{block}{Understanding Biases in AI}
    Bias in AI refers to systematic favoritism or prejudice that results in unfair outcomes when making decisions. It can arise from various sources within the data, algorithms, or the contexts in which the AI operates.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Types of Biases}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Bias}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Occurs when the data used to train an AI system is not representative of the broader population.
        \item \textbf{Example:} An AI facial recognition system trained predominantly on images of lighter-skinned individuals may perform poorly in identifying people from diverse backgrounds.
      \end{itemize}
      
    \item \textbf{Algorithmic Bias}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Results from the algorithmsâ€™ design, making certain assumptions that skew outputs.
        \item \textbf{Example:} A hiring algorithm that prioritizes candidates based on historical hiring data may inadvertently favor male candidates if the past data reflects gender bias.
      \end{itemize}
  
    \item \textbf{User Interaction Bias}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Arises from user behavior that influences AI training and behavior.
        \item \textbf{Example:} If users predominantly give a certain thumbs-up to specific content, the AI learns to promote that content, potentially sidelining diverse views or lesser-known opinions.
      \end{itemize}
      
    \item \textbf{Confirmation Bias}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition:} Refers to AI reinforcing the existing views or beliefs of users by curating information that aligns with those views.
        \item \textbf{Example:} Recommendation systems that suggest content based solely on past user behavior may create echo chambers.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Consequences of Biases}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Decision-making:} Biased AI can lead to unfair results in critical areas such as hiring, lending, and law enforcement.
    \item \textbf{Trust:} Bias undermines user trust in AI systems, resulting in decreased adoption.
    \item \textbf{Legal and Ethical Implications:} Organizations may face legal challenges or ethical scrutiny over biased AI systems.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Bias in AI is not just a technical problem but a societal one that affects individuals and communities.
      \item Recognizing and addressing bias must be part of the entire AI lifecycleâ€”from data collection to deployment.
      \item Continuous monitoring and adjustment of AI systems are crucial to mitigating biases.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Conclusion and Discussion}
  Understanding and identifying biases in AI is essential for developing ethical AI technologies that foster equality and fairness. We must strive for diverse datasets and transparent algorithms to build systems that serve all users fairly.

        \item \textbf{Privacy Issues}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Explanation:} AI systems often require large amounts of data to function effectively, raising concerns about personal privacy.
                \item \textbf{Example:} 
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Facial Recognition:} AI technologies used in public spaces can identify individuals without consent, leading to potential surveillance abuses.
                    \end{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Key Point:} Protecting individual privacy while utilizing data for AI development is a critical balancing act.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Accountability}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Explanation:} As AI systems make increasingly autonomous decisions, determining responsibility for those decisions becomes complicated.
                \item \textbf{Example:} 
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Autonomous Vehicles:} If a self-driving car gets into an accident, questions arise: Is the manufacturer, software developer, or vehicle owner liable?
                    \end{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Key Point:} Establishing clear accountability frameworks is essential to address mishaps and decisions made by AI systems.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Algorithmic Bias}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Explanation:} AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify biases present in their training data, leading to unfair outcomes.
                \item \textbf{Example:} 
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Hiring Algorithms:} If an AI recruitment tool is trained on data from previous hiring decisions, it may favor candidates from specific demographics, perpetuating systemic biases.
                    \end{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Key Point:} Ongoing monitoring and adjustments are necessary to mitigate bias and ensure fairness in AI decision-making.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Case Study 2: AI in Criminal Justice - Focus on Bias}
  \begin{block}{Understanding Bias}
    Bias occurs when an AI system reflects prejudices present in its training data, leading to unfair outcomes.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Example}: Algorithms trained on historical crime data may perpetuate biases against marginalized communities, reflecting systemic inequalities.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Case Study 2: Key Impacts on Marginalized Communities}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Increased Surveillance}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item AI tools lead to disproportionate scrutiny of communities based on historical crime data.
        \item \textbf{Example}: Predictive policing targets neighborhoods with higher recorded crimes, often linked to socio-economic disparities.
      \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sentencing Disparities}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Algorithms like COMPAS assess the likelihood of recidivism.
        \item \textbf{Issue}: Studies show COMPAS tends to over-predict the risk for Black defendants and under-predict for White defendants, leading to harsher sentencing.
      \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lack of Transparency}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Many AI systems operate as "black boxes," complicating understanding of decision-making processes.
        \item \textbf{Impact}: Raises ethical concerns about fairness and justice.

        \item Used in U.S. courts to inform sentencing; ProPublica investigation revealed it disproportionately flagged Black defendants as high risk.
      \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Facial Recognition Technology}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Increasingly used by law enforcement but often misidentifies individuals, especially in communities of color, leading to wrongful arrests.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ethical Implications}: Biased AI can reinforce systemic inequalities, undermining trust in the legal system.
