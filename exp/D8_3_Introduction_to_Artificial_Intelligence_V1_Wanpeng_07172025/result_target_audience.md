Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

### 1) Comprehensive Profile of Target Students

**Typical Background of Students**
- **Diverse Academic Exposure**: Students come from various disciplines, including computer science, engineering, business, social sciences, and humanities, leading to differing levels of exposure to technological concepts and AI.
- **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Expected foundational knowledge includes programming (preferably in Python) and basic statistics; however, students may vary greatly in their proficiency, with some being well-versed while others may have limited skills.
- **Career Aspirations**: Motivations differ, with many aiming to enter AI, data science, or tech-related roles, while others might be interested in applying AI within diverse fields such as healthcare, social policy, or business management.

**Potential Knowledge Gaps and Learning Needs**
1. **Programming Proficiency**: Limited programming skills in some students may hinder their ability to engage with AI applications, necessitating foundational coding instruction.
2. **Understanding of AI Concepts**: Students from non-technical backgrounds may struggle with core AI principles, indicating a need for introductory modules that clarify these concepts.
3. **Ethical Understanding**: A significant gap exists with regards to ethical frameworks, underscoring the importance of integrating ethical discussions thoroughly within the curriculum.
4. **Data Handling Skills**: Many students lack practical experience with data collection and cleaning, necessitating guided projects that reinforce these critical skills.
5. **Critical Evaluation Skills**: Students may not possess strong skills to critically assess AI technologies, highlighting the need for targeted activities that focus on evaluating societal impact and biases.
6. **Collaboration Skills**: Limited experience in collaborative settings, particularly in a technical context, suggests a need for structured group activities fostering communication and teamwork.

### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Revise Learning Objectives and Syllabus**
   - Clearly outline learning objectives, including a distinct module on ethical considerations in AI. Adjust the syllabus to introduce foundational AI concepts systematically, ensuring a balanced integration of technical and ethical topics.

2. **Support Initial Learning**
   - Implement pre-course programming and data management boot camps to equip students with essential skills before course commencement. Offer accessible tutorials for key concepts for those with limited technical backgrounds.

3. **Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Establish robust feedback loops through surveys and informal discussions, allowing for real-time adjustments in course material based on student experiences and needs.

4. **Enhance Faculty Collaboration**
   - Encourage interdisciplinary faculty collaborations to incorporate diverse perspectives on ethical discussions in AI. Promote continuous professional development on current AI trends for educators.

5. **Create a Dynamic Learning Environment**
   - Foster an active learning atmosphere emphasizing peer learning through collaborative projects, discussion groups, and case study analyses, encouraging students to engage with practical dilemmas in AI ethics. 

By implementing these recommendations, the course can better meet the diverse learning needs of students in "D8_3_Introduction to Artificial Intelligence", ensuring a comprehensive educational experience.
