\begin{frame}[fragile]{Key Ethical Principles - Part 2}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{2} % Set the counter to 2 for continued numbering
        \item \textbf{Autonomy}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation}: AI systems should respect the decision-making rights of individuals. Users should have control over how AI systems interact with them.
            \item \textbf{Example}: Social media platforms using AI algorithms should allow users to opt-out of data collection or change their privacy settings.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Justice}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation}: AI technologies should promote fairness and equality, ensuring that benefits and burdens are distributed equitably.
            \item \textbf{Example}: AI recruitment tools must ensure that they are not biased against any demographic, providing equal opportunities across diverse groups.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Transparency}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation}: The workings of AI systems should be understandable, and stakeholders should be able to scrutinize AI algorithms for their fairness and effectiveness.
            \item \textbf{Example}: Companies must explain how their AI algorithms make decisions, especially in critical areas like criminal justice or loan approvals.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Accountability}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Explanation}: There must be clear lines of responsibility for AI outcomes. Designers, developers, and users of AI systems should be held accountable for their actions and decisions.
            \item \textbf{Example}: If an autonomous vehicle is involved in an accident, there should be established protocols to determine liability—whether it’s the manufacturer, software developer, or the user.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts in AI Ethics - Fairness}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Fairness in AI ensures that algorithms and models avoid biased outcomes against individuals or groups, promoting equality in treatment and opportunities.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        In hiring algorithms, fairness can be affected if data reflects historical biases that disadvantage particular demographics (e.g., women or minorities). 
        Algorithms can be adjusted to enhance representation.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        It’s essential to evaluate AI systems for fairness using metrics like disparate impact, equal opportunity, and demographic parity.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts in AI Ethics - Accountability}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Accountability refers to the responsibility of individuals or organizations involved in developing and deploying AI systems to ensure ethical operation and answerability for impacts.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        If an AI system used in criminal justice incorrectly predicts recidivism, accountability must be established. Are the developers, the deploying agency, or both responsible for the unethical outcome?
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Point}
        Establishing clear lines of accountability helps prevent ethical violations and fosters trust in AI systems.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts in AI Ethics - Transparency and Privacy}
    \begin{block}{Transparency}
        \textbf{Definition}: Involves making the inner workings, processes, and decision-making of AI systems understandable and accessible to stakeholders.
        
        \textbf{Example}: If a credit scoring AI denies a loan, it must provide clear reasons for the decision to help applicants contest results.
        
        \textbf{Key Point}: Transparency builds trust as stakeholders can understand how their data is used and how predictions are made.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Privacy}
        \textbf{Definition}: Refers to the protection of personal information and data used in AI systems, adhering to ethical and legal frameworks.
        
        \textbf{Example}: AI systems tracking user behavior for recommendations should implement strict data anonymization and obtain consent before collecting sensitive data.
        
        \textbf{Key Point}: Respecting user privacy builds trust and is crucial for compliance with regulations like GDPR.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion}

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Dilemmas in AI - 1. Bias and Discrimination}
    \begin{block}{Explanation}
        AI systems can unintentionally incorporate biases from training data, resulting in unfair outcomes for certain demographic groups.
    \end{block}
    \begin{example}
        A hiring algorithm may favor male candidates if the dataset primarily includes male applicants.
    \end{example}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data Integrity:} Training data must be representative and free from bias.
        \item \textbf{Mitigation Strategies:} Techniques such as data augmentation and fairness algorithms can reduce bias.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Dilemmas in AI - 2. Privacy Concerns}
    \begin{block}{Explanation}
        AI requires vast amounts of personal data, raising concerns over privacy and data security.
    \end{block}
    \begin{example}
        Facial recognition technology used by law enforcement may lead to mass surveillance and infringe on individual rights.
    \end{example}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Informed Consent:} Users should be aware of data usage and can opt out.
        \item \textbf{Transparency and Control:} Organizations must clarify data usage and provide control over personal information.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Dilemmas in AI - 3. Accountability and Responsibility}
    \begin{block}{Explanation}
        AI systems making autonomous decisions can complicate accountability when negative outcomes occur.
    \end{block}
    \begin{example}
        In the case of an autonomous vehicle collision, questions arise about liability.
    \end{example}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Establishing Accountability:} Organizations need frameworks to determine responsibility for AI actions.
        \item \textbf{Legal and Ethical Implications:} There is a need for new regulations and guidelines for AI accountability.
