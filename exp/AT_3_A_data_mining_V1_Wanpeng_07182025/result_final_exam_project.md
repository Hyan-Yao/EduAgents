Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan for DM101: Data Mining Course

## Project Overview
The final project will replace the traditional exam and involve collaborative analysis of a real-world dataset using data mining techniques. Students will work in groups to preprocess data, apply algorithms, and present their findings, promoting analytical thinking and real-world application of data mining concepts.

## Project Objectives
By completing this project, students will be able to:
1. Apply data preprocessing and mining techniques to a real-world dataset.
2. Utilize software tools (Python/R) to implement data mining algorithms.
3. Analyze results and draw actionable insights from data.
4. Communicate findings through visualizations and presentations to various stakeholders.
5. Integrate ethical considerations in data handling and analysis.

## Project Structure and Milestones
