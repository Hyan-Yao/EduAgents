\frametitle{Key Metrics - Support, Confidence, and Lift}
    \begin{block}{3. Support}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Frequency of an itemset in the dataset.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Support}(A) = \frac{\text{Number of transactions containing A}}{\text{Total number of transactions}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If 20 out of 100 transactions include {milk, bread}, then Support = 0.20 or 20\%.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{4. Confidence}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Likelihood that item B is purchased when item A is purchased.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Confidence}(A \to B) = \frac{\text{Support}(A \cup B)}{\text{Support}(A)}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If among 20 transactions with {milk, bread}, 15 also contain {butter}, then Confidence = 0.75 or 75\%.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{5. Lift}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Measures how much more likely item B is purchased with A compared to its overall likelihood.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Lift}(A \to B) = \frac{\text{Confidence}(A \to B)}{\text{Support}(B)}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If Support({butter}) = 0.3 and Confidence({milk, bread} \to {butter}) = 0.75, then Lift = 2.5.
        \end{itemize}
