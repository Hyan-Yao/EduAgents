# Data Mining Course Assessment and Evaluation Plan

## Course Overview:
- **Course Title**: Data Mining
- **Course Code**: DM101
- **Credits**: 3

## Learning Objectives:
1. Knowledge Acquisition: Identify and define key concepts and terminology in data mining.
2. Technical Skill Development: Implement data mining algorithms using software tools like Python and R.
3. Critical Thinking: Formulate effective data mining strategies to address specific research questions or business challenges.
4. Communication Skills: Create visualizations and reports to effectively communicate data findings.

## Assessment Strategy Overview:
This assessment plan incorporates project-based evaluations, milestone-driven components, and real-world applications to gauge students' comprehension, technical skills, and analytical thinking. The final exam has been replaced with a cumulative final project.

### Assessment Components:
1. **Weekly Quizzes**: 15%
   - **Format**: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and Open-ended questions.
   - **Timing**: Weekly, after the completion of each module.
   - **Submission**: Automatically graded via the Canvas LMS.

2. **Midterm Project**: 25%
   - **Format**: Individual project including data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
   - **Milestones**:
     - **Proposal Submission** (Week 5): Outline proposed project scope and methods (10% of project grade).
     - **Progress Report** (Week 8): Summary of work done, challenges faced, and next steps (10% of project grade).
     - **Final Submission** (Week 10): A completed project report (.pdf) and presentation (.ppt or .pdf).
   - **Grading Rubric**:
     - Clarity and feasibility of proposal (20%)
     - Quality and depth of analysis (30%)
     - Effectiveness of visualizations (20%)
     - Clarity and professionalism of the final report and presentation (30%)

3. **Final Project**: 35%
   - **Format**: Group project focusing on a comprehensive data mining task relevant to a real-world scenario.
   - **Milestones**:
     - **Group Formation and Topic Selection** (Week 7): Submit a topic related to industry issues (5% of project grade).
     - **Midway Progress Check** (Week 11): Presentation of preliminary findings and methodology (10% of project grade).
     - **Final Submission** (Week 13): A full project report (.pdf), analysis (.ipynb), and group presentation (.ppt) via Canvas LMS.
   - **Grading Rubric**:
     - Depth of research and innovation in methodology (25%)
     - Analytical rigor and relevance of findings (30%)
     - Engagement and effectiveness of the presentation (20%)
     - Quality of written documentation and adherence to ethical considerations (25%)

4. **Participatory Activities**: 15%
   - **Format**: Class participation in discussions, peer reviews, and feedback on projects.
   - **Assessment**: Self and peer evaluations to reflect contribution and engagement throughout the course.

## Submission Logistics:
- **Formats**:
  - Proposals and reports: .pdf
  - Coding notebooks: .ipynb (Jupyter files)
  - Presentations: .ppt or .pdf
- **Submission Location**: Submit all assessments on Canvas LMS by the specified deadlines.
- **Feedback**: Feedback on all submissions will be provided within one week using Canvas's feedback tools.

## Grading Policy:
- **Percentage Breakdown**:
  - Weekly Quizzes: 15%
  - Midterm Project: 25%
  - Final Project: 35%
  - Participatory Activities: 15%
  
- **Grade Scale**:
  - A: 90-100%
  - B: 80-89%
  - C: 70-79%
  - D: 60-69%
  - F: Below 60%

## Conclusion:
This assessment plan emphasizes hands-on projects, iterative milestones, and real-world applications to ensure students not only learn theoretical aspects of data mining but also gain practical experience. Continuous feedback and adjustment will be implemented to enhance the learning experience. The structure and content of this plan may adapt based on student progress and feedback throughout the semester.
