    \frametitle{Understanding Neural Network Learning}
    Neural networks learn from data through a systematic process involving three primary steps: 
    \textbf{Forward Propagation, Loss Calculation,} and \textbf{Backpropagation}. 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Forward Propagation: Feed input data into the network to produce output.
        \item Loss Calculation: Measure how far predictions are from actual outputs.
        \item Backpropagation: Adjust weights to minimize loss.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Forward Propagation}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        The process where input data is fed into the network, goes through hidden layers, and produces an output.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Input neurons receive data (e.g., pixel values for images).
        \item Each neuron processes the input using a weighted sum and an activation function:
        \begin{equation}
            z = \sum (w_i \cdot x_i) + b
        \end{equation}
        where \(z\) is the input to the activation function, \(w_i\) are weights, \(x_i\) are inputs, and \(b\) is the bias.
        \item The activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid) transforms \(z\) to introduce non-linearity.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        If the image input is a grayscale pixel value (0-255), these values are normalized and fed into the network, passing through each layer.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Loss Calculation and Backpropagation}

    \begin{block}{Loss Calculation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Measures prediction accuracy: how far the network's predictions are from the actual outputs.
            \item Provides feedback on the network's performance.
            \item Common loss functions:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression:
                \begin{equation}
                    \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum (y_{true} - y_{pred})^2
                \end{equation}
                \item Cross-Entropy Loss for classification.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{block}{Key Concept}
            Smaller loss signifies better model performance.
        \end{block}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Backpropagation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Adjust weights to minimize loss.
            \item Computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight:
            \begin{equation}
                w = w - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial w}
            \end{equation}
            where \(\eta\) is the learning rate.
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{block}{Example}
            If a particular weight contributed significantly to the loss, backpropagation will reduce its value more aggressively.
        \end{block}
    \end{block}

    \frametitle{Common Challenges in Training - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Overview of Challenges}
        Training neural networks effectively can be complicated by various challenges, primarily \textbf{overfitting} and \textbf{underfitting}. Understanding these concepts is vital for building robust models.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Common Challenges in Training - Overfitting}
    \begin{block}{1. Overfitting}
        \textbf{Definition}: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers. This means the model performs excellently on training data but poorly on unseen data (validation/test sets).
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Example}
        A neural network trained on a small dataset of images of cats and dogs may classify training images with high accuracy (e.g., 95\%) but fails to generalize well to new images, resulting in low accuracy (e.g., 60\%) on validation sets.
    \end{exampleblock}
    
    \begin{block}{How to Identify}
        Monitoring the training and validation loss. Overfitting is indicated by a decreasing training loss while the validation loss begins to increase.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Strategies to Address Overfitting}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Regularization}: Techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization add a penalty to the loss function.
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Loss}_{\text{new}} = \text{Loss}_{\text{original}} + \lambda \sum w_i^2
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Dropout}: Randomly drops a fraction of neurons during training.
            \item \textbf{Data Augmentation}: Enhancing the training dataset by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, shifts).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Common Challenges in Training - Underfitting}
    \begin{block}{2. Underfitting}
        \textbf{Definition}: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture underlying data patterns, resulting in poor performance on both training and validation sets.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Example}
        A linear regression model trying to fit a nonlinear dataset will likely yield high training and validation error.
    \end{exampleblock}
    
    \begin{block}{How to Identify}
        Monitoring both training and validation loss; both losses are high, indicating the model cannot learn effectively from the data.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Strategies to Address Underfitting}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Increase Model Complexity}: Using a more complex model or adding layers and neurons.
            \item \textbf{Feature Engineering}: Adding relevant features derived from existing data.
            \item \textbf{Reducing Regularization}: If regularization is too strong, it may limit the model's ability to fit the data.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Both overfitting and underfitting indicate issues in model training that lead to poor generalization.
            \item Strategies to combat overfitting often involve complexity reduction, while strategies for underfitting typically focus on increasing model capacity.
            \item Regular monitoring of training and validation performance is essential for diagnosing and addressing these challenges.

    \frametitle{Evaluation Metrics - Overview}
    Evaluating neural network models is essential to understanding their performance. 
    Key metrics provide insights into how well the model is predicting outputs based on the inputs. 
    This slide will discuss four primary evaluation metrics:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Accuracy}
        \item \textbf{Precision}
        \item \textbf{Recall}
        \item \textbf{F1 Score}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Evaluation Metrics - 1. Accuracy}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances. 
        It's a measure of how often the classifier is correct.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
        \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}
        \end{equation}
        where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{TP}: True Positives
            \item \textbf{TN}: True Negatives
            \item \textbf{FP}: False Positives
            \item \textbf{FN}: False Negatives
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a binary classification model predicting whether emails are spam:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 80 emails classified correctly (TP + TN)
            \item 20 emails misclassified (FP + FN)
            \item \textbf{Accuracy} = \( \frac{80}{100} = 0.8 \) or 80\%
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Evaluation Metrics - 2. Precision}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Precision measures the correctness of positive predictions. It tells us how many of the predicted positive cases were actually positive.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
        \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        In the spam detection scenario:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 80 spam emails predicted (TP) but 10 were not spam (FP).
            \item \textbf{Precision} = \( \frac{80}{80 + 10} = \frac{80}{90} \approx 0.89 \) or 89\%
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Evaluation Metrics - 3. Recall (Sensitivity)}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Recall quantifies the model’s ability to find all the relevant cases (true positive cases). 
        It indicates how many actual positives were correctly predicted.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
        \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        From the same model:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 80 actual spam emails (TP), but the model missed 20 (FN).
            \item \textbf{Recall} = \( \frac{80}{80 + 20} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8 \) or 80\%
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Evaluation Metrics - 4. F1 Score}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. 
        It provides a balance between the two metrics, useful when the class distribution is imbalanced.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
        \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        Continuing with our spam detector:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item From previous calculations, Precision = 0.89 and Recall = 0.8.
            \item \textbf{F1 Score} = \( 2 \times \frac{0.89 \times 0.8}{0.89 + 0.8} \approx 0.843 \)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Importance of Metrics:} Each metric serves a different purpose. Use accuracy for balanced datasets, but apply precision and recall in imbalanced situations.
        \item \textbf{Model Evaluation:} Always consider multiple metrics to get a comprehensive view of model performance.
        \item \textbf{Real-World Impact:} Metrics can significantly affect decisions in applications such as fraud detection, where false positives may have expensive consequences.
    \end{itemize}
    
    Understanding evaluation metrics not only clarifies the performance of your model but also informs further tuning and modifications to enhance its accuracy and effectiveness in real-world applications.
