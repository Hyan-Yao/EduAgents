\frametitle{How Decision Trees Work - Key Points & Conclusion}
    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Interpretability:} Easy to interpret and visualize.
            \item \textbf{Non-Parametric Nature:} No assumption of underlying data distribution.
            \item \textbf{Tendency to Overfit:} Sensitive to noise; requires management (e.g., pruning).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Decision trees are fundamental in machine learning, providing clear decision-making through intuitive structures. Understanding entropy and information gain is essential for building effective decision trees.
