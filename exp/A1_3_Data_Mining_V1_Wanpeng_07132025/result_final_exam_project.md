Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan: Data Mining - Real-World Applications

### I. Project Description
Students will engage in a collaborative final project that replaces the traditional exam, focusing on real-world data challenges. Each group will select a relevant issue, formulate a hypothesis, collect data, and apply data mining techniques to derive insights.

### II. Objectives
1. Analyze a real-world data challenge using data mining techniques.
2. Foster teamwork and collaboration among peers.
3. Develop critical thinking and analytical skills.
4. Emphasize ethical considerations in data mining practices.

### III. Timeline with Milestones
- **Week 1-5**: Team Formation and Topic Selection
- **Week 6**: Project Proposal Submission
- **Week 7-9**: Data Collection and Initial Analysis
- **Week 10**: Progress Report Submission
- **Week 11-13**: Final Analysis and Report Preparation
- **Week 14**: Final Project Submission (Report & Presentation)

### IV. Deliverables
1. **Project Proposal (Due Week 6)**
   - Format: PDF (2-3 pages)
   - Content: Title, Team Members, Introduction, Proposed Data, Methodology, Expected Outcomes.

2. **Progress Report (Due Week 10)**
   - Format: PDF or Jupyter Notebook
   - Content: Current Status, Data Acquired, Methodologies Implemented, Challenges Encountered.

3. **Final Project Submission (Due Week 14)**
   - Report Format: PDF (10-15 pages)
   - Presentation Format: Live or recorded (10-15 minutes)

### V. Grading Rubric
- **Project Proposal (15%)**: Clarity, relevance, feasibility, ethical considerations.
- **Progress Report (10%)**: Depth of analysis, adaptability, documentation quality, teamwork dynamics.
- **Final Report (40%)**: Methodologies used, insights derived.
- **Final Presentation (20%)**: Quality and engagement.
- **Teamwork Contribution (10%)**: Peer evaluation.

### VI. Submission Formats
- All submissions will be made through Canvas.
- Project Proposal and Progress Reports: PDF/Python Notebook.
- Final Report: PDF.
- Presentation: Live or recorded video.

### VII. Academic Integrity Guidelines
- Adherence to university academic integrity policies is mandatory.
- All team members will sign an agreement confirming compliance.
- Ethical implications of data mining will be discussed, and students will reflect these considerations in their final report.

### VIII. Feedback Mechanisms
- Peer Feedback: Participants will evaluate each other's contributions.
- Instructor Checkpoints: Feedback will be provided during proposal and progress report submissions.

### IX. Resources and Tools
- Instruction on necessary Python libraries will be provided, alongside relevant real datasets.

### Conclusion
This structure fosters studentsâ€™ capacity to apply data mining techniques to address real-world issues collaboratively, while promoting ethical practices and analytical skills necessary for future data professionals.
