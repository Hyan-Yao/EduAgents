## Key Components of Assessment

### 1. Programming Assignments (40%)
- **Format**: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) submitted via Canvas LMS.
- **Timing**: Weekly assignments due every Friday (Week 2 to Week 8).
- **Types**: Open-ended questions requiring code implementation and analytical write-ups.
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Correctness (40%): Accuracy of code and outputs.
  - Creativity and Complexity (30%): Incorporation of advanced features or innovative approaches.
  - Documentation and Clarity (30%): Quality of code documentation and clarity of explanations.

### 2. Team Project (40%)
- **Concept**: Capstone project addressing a real-world data mining problem.
- **Milestones**:
  - **Proposal Submission (Week 6)**: Project proposal (.pdf) including objectives, datasets, and methodologies.
    - Graded on clarity, relevance, and feasibility (15%).
  - **Progress Report (Week 10)**: Status update (.pdf or Jupyter Notebook) detailing methods and challenges faced.
    - Graded on depth of analysis and teamwork dynamics (10%).
  - **Final Project Submission (Week 14)**: Comprehensive report (.pdf) and a presentation (live or recorded).
- **Grading Rubric**:
  - Content and Methodology (40%): Appropriateness and execution of data mining techniques.
  - Analysis and Insights (30%): Quality of insights drawn and relevance to the problem statement.
  - Presentation and Design (20%): Clarity and engagement of the presentation, including visual aids.
  - Collaboration and Teamwork (10%): Peer evaluations assessing contribution to the project.

### 3. Participation and Engagement (20%)
- **Components**: Class discussions, peer reviews, and engagement in ethical discussions.
- **Assessment Method**: 
  - Weekly self-reflections on participation (submitted via Canvas), graded on qualitative depth and relevance to course topics.
  - Peer reviews on team project proposals and presentations.

## Submission Logistics
- **File Formats**: 
  - Coding assignments: .ipynb files via Canvas.
  - Team project proposals, reports, and progress reports: .pdf.
- **Submission Guidelines**: Each submission must include a cover page with project title, team names, and submission date.

---

## Cumulative Final Project
- **Final Project Presentation**: Scheduled in Week 14, teams present findings to the class.
- **Reflection Paper**: Each student submits a reflection (.pdf) discussing learned concepts and applications.

---

## Ethics Integration
- Ethical considerations will be integrated throughout the course and assessed via participation grading and project evaluations. 

---

## Adjustment and Feedback Mechanism
- Regular feedback will be solicited from students to refine course materials and assignments.
- Office hours and regular check-ins will support student needs and comprehension.

---

## Transparency and Clarity
- Adherence to institutional policies regarding academic integrity, harassment, discrimination, disability accommodations, and copyright responsibilities.
