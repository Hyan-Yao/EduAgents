**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Classification algorithms are designed to predict categories or labels for data points, which allows applications like spam detection, medical diagnosis, and customer segmentation.

**Question 2:** Which metric is most useful when dealing with imbalanced class distributions?

  A) Accuracy
  B) Precision
  C) F1 Score
  D) Recall

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The F1 Score provides a balance between precision and recall and is particularly useful when the class distribution is imbalanced, ensuring that both false positives and false negatives are considered.

**Question 3:** Which classification algorithm uses a tree-like model for decision making?

  A) Logistic Regression
  B) Neural Networks
  C) Decision Trees
  D) Support Vector Machines

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Decision Trees use a flowchart-like structure to make decisions based on input features, making them intuitive and straightforward.

**Question 4:** In which of the following applications would classification algorithms be particularly beneficial?

  A) Sorting emails as spam or not spam
  B) Analyzing time series data
  C) Calculating the average of dataset
  D) Filtering out noise in images

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Classification algorithms, such as those used in spam detection, effectively categorize emails as spam or not based on their features.
