  A) K-Means
  B) DBSCAN
  C) Hierarchical Clustering
  D) Spectral Clustering

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Hierarchical Clustering is designed to build a tree of clusters, allowing users to understand data relationships at multiple levels.

**Question 3:** What is a significant consideration when applying clustering techniques?

  A) The quality of the clustering algorithm is always the same
  B) Data quality and preprocessing significantly affect results
  C) Clustering requires labeled data
  D) Clustering results are always perfect

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The effectiveness of clustering is largely dependent on the quality and preprocessing of the input data.

**Question 4:** In which area can clustering techniques be applied for better decision-making?

  A) Financial reporting only
  B) Only in scientific research
  C) Customer segmentation and personalized marketing
  D) Data entry processes

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Clustering is often used in businesses for customer segmentation to tailor marketing strategies based on customer behaviors.

### Activities
- Create a case study where clustering techniques are applied to a real-world dataset. Discuss your findings and the implications of the identified clusters.
- Design a simple clustering algorithm from scratch using a programming language of your choice, then apply it to a small dataset.

### Discussion Questions
- How would you approach a situation where you have to choose a clustering algorithm for a specific dataset?
- What challenges might arise when trying to cluster high-dimensional data, and how can they be addressed?
