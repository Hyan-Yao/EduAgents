Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

1. Students will broadly articulate the principles and processes of data mining, specifically identifying key stages in the data mining lifecycle and their relevance to real-world data challenges.

2. Students will demonstrate measurable skills in implementing data mining techniques using Python through hands-on programming assignments scored using rubric-based evaluations.

3. Students will apply various data mining algorithms (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, clustering techniques) on real datasets and analyze their effectiveness based on various data attributes such as imbalanced datasets and handling missing data.

4. Students will assess and compare model performance using a set of standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) and provide justifications for the chosen methods of evaluation in diverse scenarios.

5. Students will explore the functionalities of advanced data mining techniques, including deep learning and generative models, and apply them strategically in various contexts relevant to modern data science applications.

6. Students will collaborate in teams to design, execute, and present a comprehensive data mining project that addresses a significant real-world issue, with clear criteria for evaluation of teamwork dynamics.

7. Students will engage in peer-reviewed discussions regarding ethical case studies in data mining, reflecting on accountability and industry standards related to data privacy and algorithmic integrity.
