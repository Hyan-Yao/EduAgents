# Final Project Plan: Real-World Data Mining Challenge: Applying Techniques and Addressing Ethical Considerations

## Project Description
This project invites students to explore a real-world dataset through the application of data mining techniques. Participants will analyze data, extract valuable insights, and contemplate the ethical implications surrounding their findings. The collaborative proposal phase sets the stage for developing skills in teamwork and critical thinking, while the final deliverables encourage individual thought and comprehensive analysis.

## Objectives
- Apply data mining techniques to a real-world dataset.
- Encourage critical thinking and analysis of data insights.
- Reflect on ethical considerations in data mining practices.
- Develop skills in report writing and oral presentations.
