    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Association Rule Learning is a fundamental method in data mining and machine learning that identifies relationships between variables in large datasets. This method is particularly used in market basket analysis, where the goal is to uncover patterns in purchasing behavior.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Concepts}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Association Rules:} 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Expressed as \( A \Rightarrow B \)
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Support:} 
                \begin{equation}
                    \text{Support}(A) = \frac{\text{Number of transactions containing } A}{\text{Total number of transactions}}
                \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Confidence:} 
                \begin{equation}
                    \text{Confidence}(A \Rightarrow B) = \frac{\text{Support}(A \cup B)}{\text{Support}(A)}

    \frametitle{Understanding Association Rules - Definition}
    \begin{block}{What are Association Rules?}
        Association rules are essential components of data mining used to discover relationships between variables in large datasets.
        Typically applied in market basket analysis, they help identify patterns in consumer behavior by revealing how the occurrence of one item is associated with another.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Association Rules - Components}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Antecedent (Left Hand Side - LHS):} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The condition or item(s) present indicating potential associations. 
            \item Example: In the rule "If a customer buys bread, they are likely to buy butter," the antecedent is "buying bread."
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Consequent (Right Hand Side - RHS):} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The outcome or item(s) likely to occur if the antecedent is present. 
            \item Example: In the same rule, the consequent is "buying butter."
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Association Rules - Example and Conclusion}
    
    \textbf{Example of an Association Rule:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Rule:} \{Milk\} $\rightarrow$ \{Cookies\}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Interpretation:} If a customer buys Milk (Antecedent), they are likely to also purchase Cookies (Consequent).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Key Points:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Association rules help organizations understand purchasing patterns.
        \item They guide businesses in optimizing product placements and tailoring marketing strategies.
        \item Mastery of terms like LHS and RHS is crucial for interpreting rules and their implications.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Conclusion:}
    Association rules serve as powerful tools in data mining, especially within market basket analysis. 
    Mastering terms such as antecedent and consequent, along with metrics like support and confidence, provides foundational insights for data interpretation and strategy formulation. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Support, Confidence, and Lift - Introduction}
    \begin{block}{Key Metrics in Association Rule Learning}
        In association rule learning, we evaluate the strength and significance of rules using three fundamental metrics:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Support
            \item Confidence
            \item Lift
        \end{itemize}
        Each metric provides different insights into the relationships among items in a dataset.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Support}
    \frametitle{Support - Definition and Formula}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Support is the proportion of the database that contains a particular item or itemset. It helps determine how frequently an itemset appears in the data.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Support}(A) = \frac{\text{Number of transactions containing } A}{\text{Total number of transactions}}
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a supermarket database of 1000 transactions, if 300 transactions include both bread and butter:
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Support}(\text{Bread, Butter}) = \frac{300}{1000} = 0.3
        \end{equation}
        This indicates that 30\% of the transactions include both bread and butter.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Confidence}
    \frametitle{Confidence - Definition and Formula}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Confidence measures the likelihood that item B is purchased when item A is purchased. It reflects the strength of the association between the items.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Confidence}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\text{Support}(A \cup B)}{\text{Support}(A)}
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        If bread appears in 400 transactions total:
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Confidence}(\text{Bread} \rightarrow \text{Butter}) = \frac{300/1000}{400/1000} = \frac{300}{400} = 0.75
        \end{equation}
        This indicates a 75\% chance that if a customer buys bread, they will also buy butter.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Lift}
    \frametitle{Lift - Definition and Formula}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Lift evaluates the effectiveness of a rule over the expected frequency of item B, assuming independence. A lift greater than 1 indicates a positive correlation.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Lift}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\text{Confidence}(A \rightarrow B)}{\text{Support}(B)}
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        Assuming butter has a support of 0.4:
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Lift}(\text{Bread} \rightarrow \text{Butter}) = \frac{0.75}{0.4} = 1.875
        \end{equation}
        This suggests that customers who buy bread are 1.875 times more likely to buy butter than expected if the purchases were independent.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Key Takeaways}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Support** indicates the popularity of itemsets in the dataset.
        \item **Confidence** indicates the reliability of the association rule.
        \item **Lift** helps assess the strength of the association relative to randomness.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Illustration}
        A Venn diagram could visually represent the relationships between A, B, and their intersections in the context of support, and how confidence and lift derive from these intersections.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Apriori Algorithm Steps - Steps to Execute}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Define Minimum Support and Confidence}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Support: Frequency of items appearing in the dataset.
            \item Confidence: Frequency of items appearing together in transactions.
            \item Example: In 100 transactions, if 30 include both Bread and Butter, support for {Bread} $\Rightarrow$ {Butter} is 0.3.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Generate Candidate Itemsets}

        \item \textbf{Calculate Support for Itemsets}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Count occurrences in transactions and filter out low-support itemsets.
            \item Example: {A, B} in 15 out of 100 transactions gives support of 0.15.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Generate New Candidate Itemsets}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Combine frequent itemsets to create new candidates.

        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Prune the Candidate Itemsets}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Eliminate candidates that have infrequent subsets; if an itemset is frequent, all subsets must also be.
            \item Example: {A, B} pruned if {A} is infrequent.

    \frametitle{Challenges in Association Rule Learning - Key Challenges (cont.)}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
        \item \textbf{Low Interpretability:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The volume of generated rules can complicate deriving actionable insights from them.
            \item \textit{Example:} Supermarkets may generate thousands of rules, overwhelming the decision-making process.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Support and Confidence Issues:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item High support rules may not be interesting, and high confidence rules may not hold across data subsets.
            \item \textit{Formulas:}
                \begin{equation}
                \text{Support}(A) = \frac{\text{Number of transactions containing } A}{\text{Total number of transactions}}
                \end{equation}
                \begin{equation}
                \text{Confidence}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\text{Support}(A \cap B)}{\text{Support}(A)}
                \end{equation}
            \item Misleading conclusions can arise from improper data analysis.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Sparsity of Data:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Datasets may be sparse, leading to unreliable rule generation.
            \item \textit{Example:} Frequent purchases might not include all possible item combinations, skewing results.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Challenges in Association Rule Learning - Key Challenges (cont.)}
    \begin{enumerate}[resume]
        \item \textbf{Dynamic Nature of Data:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Item relationships can change over time, making static rules less relevant.
            \item \textit{Example:} Seasonal variations in consumer behavior necessitate frequent updates to the rules.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Overfitting:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Excessive rule generation may lead to fitting noise rather than actual patterns, impairing predictive performance.
            \item \textit{Solution:} Employ regularization techniques or limit the number of generated rules.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
