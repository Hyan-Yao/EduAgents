\frametitle{Application in Market Basket Analysis}
    \begin{block}{Usage}
        In market basket analysis, retailers analyze transaction data to discover combinations of products that frequently co-occur in purchases. This information helps in:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Product Placement:} Positioning items bought together in close proximity.
            \item \textbf{Cross-Selling Opportunities:} Making recommendations based on purchasing patterns.
            \item \textbf{Inventory Management:} Guiding stocking decisions based on demand for related items.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Consider a dataset of transactions from a grocery store.
            \item Example Rule: Milk â‡’ Bread
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Support: 60\% (3/5 transactions)
                \item Confidence: 75\% (3 transactions with both items out of 4 with Milk)
                \item Lift: 1.5 (indicates a positive association)
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
