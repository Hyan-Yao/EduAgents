\frametitle{Example Use Case}
    Suppose we have a dataset for predicting housing prices with features like area, number of rooms, and age:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Feature selection reveals 'area' and 'number of rooms' as highly predictive.
        \item 'Age' shows limited value.
        \item PCA can further simplify the model, combining area and room count for better predictive power.
    \end{itemize}

    The techniques discussed here are essential for any data scientist focused on building effective models swiftly.
