Assessment & Evaluation Planning
================================

# Assessment and Evaluation Plan for "Foundations of Machine Learning"

---

## Overview
This assessment plan emphasizes project-based, milestone-driven activities to foster real-world application, critical thinking, and analytical skills among undergraduate students studying machine learning. Traditional exam-heavy approaches are replaced with cumulative capstone projects, ensuring comprehension through practical engagements.

## Learning Objectives
1. Describe foundational principles and terminologies of machine learning.
2. Identify and explain types of machine learning.
3. Demonstrate data management skills related to data quality and preparation.
4. Build and evaluate models using accessible tools.
5. Analyze model performance using basic metrics.
6. Discuss societal impacts of AI and machine learning.
7. Engage in interdisciplinary applications of machine learning.
8. Research current trends in the field.
