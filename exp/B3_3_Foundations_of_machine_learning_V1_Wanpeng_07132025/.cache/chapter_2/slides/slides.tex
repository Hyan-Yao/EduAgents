    \frametitle{What is Supervised Learning? - Definition}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset. This means that for every input data point, there is a corresponding output label.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Goal}
        The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, allowing the algorithm to make predictions on new, unseen data.
    \end{block}

    \frametitle{What is Supervised Learning? - Key Processes}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Labeled Data}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The foundation of supervised learning is a labeled dataset containing pairs of input features and their corresponding output labels.
                \item \textit{Example:} In a dataset for predicting house prices, each entry might contain square footage, number of bedrooms, and location, with the corresponding house price as the output.
            \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Training Phase}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item During training, the algorithm learns from the labeled data by adjusting its internal parameters to minimize the difference between its predicted outputs and the actual labels.
                \item \textit{Analogy:} Think of a teacher providing feedback on a student's answers.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Concept:} Algorithms can perpetuate or exacerbate biases present in training data, leading to unfair outcomes.
        \item \textbf{Example:} A hiring algorithm trained on biased historical employment data may favor male candidates over equally qualified females.
        \item \textbf{Key Point:} Ensure diverse and representative training datasets to mitigate bias.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{2. Transparency and Accountability}
