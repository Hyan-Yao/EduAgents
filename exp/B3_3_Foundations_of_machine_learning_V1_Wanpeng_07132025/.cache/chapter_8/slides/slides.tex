    \frametitle{Machine Learning in Finance - Overview}
    Machine learning (ML) is dramatically transforming the financial landscape, providing institutions with tools to enhance efficiency, reduce risk, and make informed decisions. This slide explores three primary applications of machine learning in finance:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Fraud Detection}
        \item \textbf{Algorithmic Trading}
        \item \textbf{Credit Scoring}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Machine Learning in Finance - Fraud Detection}
    \textbf{Explanation:} Fraud detection involves identifying suspicious transactions that may indicate fraudulent activities, such as credit card fraud or identity theft. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast datasets in real-time to distinguish between normal and fraudulent behavior.

    \textbf{Example:} Transaction Monitoring
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A model trained on historical transaction data flags transactions that deviate from normal spending patterns. For instance, a $500 withdrawal in a different country could trigger a fraud alert for someone who usually spends $20–$100 at local businesses.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Key Points:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use of supervised learning techniques (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression).
        \item Models improve continuously with more data, adapting to new fraud patterns.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Machine Learning in Finance - Algorithmic Trading}
    \textbf{Explanation:} Algorithmic trading employs sophisticated algorithms to execute trades at optimal prices by analyzing market data, such as price movements and trading volumes.

    \textbf{Example:} High-Frequency Trading (HFT)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item HFT algorithms execute thousands of trades per second by exploiting price discrepancies. An algorithm can buy stocks just before the market reacts to a significant news event affecting those stocks.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Key Points:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Techniques like reinforcement learning adapt trading strategies.
        \item Real-time sentiment analysis from news or social media enhances decision-making.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Machine Learning in Finance - Credit Scoring}
    \textbf{Explanation:} Credit scoring models evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals/businesses, influencing lending decisions. Machine learning improves these by using a wider range of data inputs.

    \textbf{Example:} Predictive Analytics
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Instead of just credit history (FICO score), machine learning models may analyze social media, transaction histories, and employment patterns for a comprehensive risk assessment.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Key Points:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use of unsupervised learning to discover hidden patterns in customer behavior.
        \item Addressing fairness and bias in modeling is essential, highlighting the need for explainable AI in finance.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Machine Learning in Finance - Conclusion}
    Machine learning is reshaping how financial institutions operate:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Safeguarding transactions
        \item Optimizing trading strategies
        \item Transforming credit assessments into holistic evaluations
    \end{itemize}

    As technology evolves, the potential applications of ML in finance will expand, offering new opportunities and challenges.
    
    \textbf{References:} Consider resources focusing on machine learning models like decision trees and neural networks for deeper insights into their applications in finance.
