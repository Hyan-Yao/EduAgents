\frametitle{Machine Learning in Finance - Fraud Detection}
    \textbf{Explanation:} Fraud detection involves identifying suspicious transactions that may indicate fraudulent activities, such as credit card fraud or identity theft. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast datasets in real-time to distinguish between normal and fraudulent behavior.

    \textbf{Example:} Transaction Monitoring
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A model trained on historical transaction data flags transactions that deviate from normal spending patterns. For instance, a $500 withdrawal in a different country could trigger a fraud alert for someone who usually spends $20â€“$100 at local businesses.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Key Points:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use of supervised learning techniques (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression).
        \item Models improve continuously with more data, adapting to new fraud patterns.
    \end{itemize}
