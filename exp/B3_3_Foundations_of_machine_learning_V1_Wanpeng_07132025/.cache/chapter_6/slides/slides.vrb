\frametitle{Encouragement for Critical Assessment}
    As future data scientists, it's important to approach model evaluation critically:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Ask Questions:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Does this model meet performance criteria for its application?
                \item What trade-offs exist between different metrics?
                \item How can we further refine the model?
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Experiment and Iterate:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Model evaluation is an ongoing process.
                \item Don't hesitate to revisit and revise based on new data or feedback.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Key Takeaways:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Evaluation metrics are essential for effective model selection and improvement.
        \item Regular assessments ensure alignment with desired outcomes.
        \item Embrace continuous learning and questioning for robust model deployment.
    \end{itemize}

    In conclusion, model evaluation is crucial for developing trustworthy data-driven solutions.
