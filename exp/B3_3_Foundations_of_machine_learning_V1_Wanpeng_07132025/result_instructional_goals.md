### Course Objectives for Foundations of Machine Learning

1. **Foundational Understanding of Machine Learning Concepts**:
   - Students will describe the basic principles of machine learning and its terminologies, recognizing key processes involved in model development.
   - Students will identify different types of machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement) and articulate their applications in real-world scenarios.

2. **Data Management and Preparation**:
   - Students will explain the importance of data quality and preparation in machine learning.
   - Students will demonstrate basic data handling skills, including data cleaning and normalization, using user-friendly tools like Google Sheets or similar platforms.

3. **Exploring Machine Learning Tools and Technologies**:
   - Students will utilize accessible machine learning tools and platforms (such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Keras) to build and evaluate simple models, with clearly defined learning outcomes associated with each tool.

4. **Analyzing Model Performance**:
   - Students will assess machine learning models using basic performance metrics (such as accuracy, precision, and recall) in straightforward, non-technical terms.

5. **Ethical Considerations and Societal Impact**:
   - Students will discuss the responsible use of machine learning technologies, focusing on real-world implications and considerations, including data dependency and algorithmic bias.

6. **Capstone Project**:
   - Students will develop a small-scale machine learning project, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, while presenting their models to peers to discuss strengths and limitations.

7. **Interdisciplinary Applications**:
   - Students will explore case studies demonstrating the interdisciplinary applications of machine learning in fields such as healthcare, finance, and marketing, incorporating guest speakers or relevant local industry examples.

8. **Industry Trends and Future Directions**:
   - Students will research and discuss current trends and future directions in the machine learning field, fostering collaboration and teamwork by working in groups to present findings.
