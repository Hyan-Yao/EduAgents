Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan: "Machine Learning in Real-World Scenarios" 

## Project Overview
The final project is designed to replace the traditional exam by focusing on critical thinking and problem-solving through the exploration of machine learning applications in various industries. Students will collaborate in teams to analyze a machine learning project relevant to current trends in sectors like healthcare, finance, and marketing.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, students will be able to:
1. Describe foundational principles and terminologies of machine learning.
2. Identify different types of machine learning and their real-world applications.
3. Demonstrate data management skills and address data quality issues.
4. Use accessible machine learning tools to build and evaluate simple models.
5. Analyze model performance and articulate findings to a peer audience.
6. Discuss societal impacts, ethical considerations, and trends related to AI and machine learning.
