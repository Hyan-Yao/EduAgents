# Final Project Plan

## Project Title: Scalable Data Processing Solution for a Real-World Scenario

### Description
This project involves the development of a scalable data processing solution addressing a real-world problem, such as processing large datasets for public health monitoring. Students will apply industry-standard tools and ethical practices to create effective data architectures, analyze system integrations, and reflect on their learning journey.

### Objectives
1. Define and articulate core data processing concepts applied to real-world cases.
2. Demonstrate proficiency in industry-standard data processing tools by developing a scalable architecture.
3. Analyze and implement ethical practices in data processing.
4. Collaborate effectively in teams or individually to produce a comprehensive project.
