# Final Project Plan: Data Processing Pipeline Development and Ethical Analysis

## Project Description
The project involves developing a data processing pipeline using Python, Hadoop, and Spark. Students will explore key concepts in big data processing while analyzing the ethical implications of data handling, ensuring data compliance with frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA.

## Objectives
1. Analyze and explain key concepts in big data processing, such as ETL and data warehousing.
2. Design and implement a functional data processing pipeline using appropriate technologies.
3. Assess relevant ethical frameworks and apply them to real-world data scenarios.
4. Demonstrate problem-solving skills through collaborative engagement with operational data challenges.
5. Effectively utilize software tools and libraries to develop an ETL pipeline.

## Timeline with Milestones
- **Week 6**: Project Proposal
  - Submission of written proposals in .pdf format detailing dataset choice, ETL design, and ethical considerations.
  
- **Week 8**: Progress Update
  - Submission of progress reports in .pdf format and delivery of team presentations.
  
- **Week 12**: Final Deliverable
  - Submission of three components:
    - Written Report (.pdf)
    - Code Documentation (Jupyter Notebooks .ipynb)
    - Final Presentation (Slides in .pdf)

## Deliverables
1. Project Proposal (Week 6)
2. Progress Report and Presentation (Week 8)
3. Final Written Report, Code Documentation, and Final Presentation (Week 12)
