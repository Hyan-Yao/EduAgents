\frametitle{Key Concepts: Data Lakes & Data Warehousing}
    \begin{block}{Data Lakes}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: A centralized repository that allows storage of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data at scale in its raw format.
            \item \textbf{Characteristics}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Flexible schema (schema-on-read).
                \item Cost-effective storage with tools like Hadoop or cloud services (e.g., Amazon S3).
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Example}: A data lake can store logs from IoT devices, social media feeds, and video files for analysis without needing prior structuring.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Data Warehousing}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: A structured storage platform designed for analysis and reporting, primarily dealing with structured data.
            \item \textbf{Characteristics}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Optimized for read-heavy operations and query performance.
                \item Supports analytical tools for insights via reports and dashboards.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Example}: A financial institution's data warehouse contains tables for transactions, customers, and accounts facilitating complex monthly reporting queries.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
