# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: CL_3_C_data_processing_at_scale

## 1. Faculty Expertise Requirements
### 1.1. Subject Matter Expertise
- Strong foundation in large-scale data processing and data science concepts.
- Familiarity with processing tools such as Hadoop and Spark.
- Comprehension of data ethics and governance frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

### 1.2. Teaching Experience
- Previous experience in teaching technical subjects, particularly those with practical lab components.
- Ability to convey complex concepts in an understandable manner.

### 1.3. Software Proficiency
- Proficient in Python, particularly with libraries such as Pandas and Spark SQL.
- Understanding of data processing pipelines and frameworks, facilitating hands-on learning.

## 2. Necessary Computing Resources
### 2.1. Hardware
- Adequate computational resources to process large datasets, which may include:
  - Dedicated lab setups or powerful cloud computing options for simulations.

### 2.2. Facilities
- Access to computer labs equipped with:
  - High-performance hardware to run data processing frameworks efficiently.
  
### 2.3. Backup Solutions
- Ensure robust data backup solutions are in place to prevent data loss during project implementations.

## 3. Software Requirements
### 3.1. Core Software Tools 
- Installation and configuration of the following software:
  - Hadoop and Spark for data processing.
  - Python and relevant libraries (Pandas, Spark SQL).

### 3.2. Version Control
- Specification of software versions must be clear to avoid compatibility issues; this should reflect user feedback on prerequisites.

### 3.3. Installation Guidelines
- Comprehensive installation manuals should be provided, detailing:
  - Steps for installing and configuring necessary software.

## 4. Scheduling Constraints
### 4.1. Class and Lab Schedule
- Allocate sufficient time for both theory and practical sessions to avoid cognitive overload on students.

### 4.2. Course Duration and Frequency
- Adjust course duration and frequency to ensure comprehensive coverage of ethical and governance topics.

### 4.3. Flexible Class Formats
- Consider hybrid delivery modes to accommodate diverse learning preferences.

## 5. Facility Limitations
### 5.1. Room Size and Technology
- Classrooms/labs must be spacious enough for individual and group work with necessary audiovisual technology.

### 5.2. Remote Access Availability
- Provide options for remote access to lab environments to alleviate physical space constraints.

## 6. TA Support Availability
### 6.1. Support Structure
- Evaluate the need for Teaching Assistant (TA) support based on class enrollment size.

### 6.2. TA Training
- Ensure TAs are trained in relevant technologies and pedagogical strategies to assist students effectively.

## 7. Conclusion and Recommendations
### 7.1. Targeted Professional Development
- Offer faculty development programs focusing on areas highlighted in feedback, including pedagogical strategies and software guidance.

### 7.2. Iterative Course Development
- Incorporate regular student feedback to adapt the syllabus and resources dynamically.

### 7.3. Comprehensive Documentation
- Establish a central "course playbook" containing instructions, guidelines, and policies for faculty and students.
