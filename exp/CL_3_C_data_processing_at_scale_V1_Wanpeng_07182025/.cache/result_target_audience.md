Target Audience & Needs Analysis
================================

**1) Comprehensive Profile of Target Students**

- **Typical Background**: 
  - Students are primarily focused on data processing and data science, coming from fields such as:
    - **Computer Science/Engineering**: Basic knowledge of programming, data structures, and algorithms.
    - **Data Science/Analytics**: Some familiarity with statistical analysis and data visualization techniques.
    - **Business and Management**: Interest in leveraging data for decision-making processes.

- **Prerequisite Knowledge**:
  - **Basic Programming Skills**: Proficiency in programming concepts, ideally in Python, for lab work.
  - **Introductory Statistics**: A fundamental understanding of statistics to facilitate data analysis.
  - **Knowledge of Data Processing Tools**: Beneficial, but not required, familiarity with platforms such as Hadoop and Spark.

- **Career Aspirations**:
  - Many students aspire to become:
    - **Data Analysts/Scientists**: Focusing on data processing and analytical skills.
    - **Business Intelligence Consultants**: Aiming to understand and apply data governance and ethics.
    - **Data Engineers**: Looking to design and implement data pipelines and processing frameworks.

- **Potential Knowledge Gaps and Learning Needs**:
  1. **Terminology Clarity**: Difficulty with undefined terms like “ETL” and “data warehousing” necessitating clearer definitions.
  2. **Software Proficiency**: Need for detailed guides and tutorials for tools such as Hadoop and Spark.
  3. **Understanding Ethical Implications**: Insufficient time allocated to explore ethics in-depth, most importantly for students lacking a background in regulatory frameworks.
  4. **Assessment Mapping**: Disconnection between assessments and learning objectives causing confusion about expectations.
  5. **Resource Variability**: Inconsistent information in the syllabus leading to difficulties in planning and progression.
  6. **Accessibility to Remote Learning**: Requirement for accessible remote lab work options to support diverse preferences.

**2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments**

- **Refine Learning Objectives**: Use specific and observable language for learning outcomes to clarify expectations and improve assessment methods.

- **Enhance Prerequisite Guidance**: Provide thorough details regarding software installation, versions, and initial workshops focused on basic programming skills and necessary tools.

- **Allocate Time Strategically**: Dedicate sufficient time for discussions on ethics and governance frameworks by integrating them throughout the course rather than in a single section.

- **Improve Assessment Alignment**: Create a detailed mapping document linking assessments to learning objectives to clarify evaluation criteria for students.

- **Structured Documentation**: Develop a centralized "course playbook" that contains complete and well-organized information regarding guidelines, resources, and course logistics.

- **Accessibility and Flexibility in Learning**: Prioritize remote access solutions for lab environments and consider hybrid delivery formats to cater to diverse learning preferences.
