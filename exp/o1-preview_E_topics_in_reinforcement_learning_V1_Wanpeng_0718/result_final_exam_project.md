Final Project Assessment Design
===============================

# Final Project Plan: "Designing an Ethical Reinforcement Learning Agent for a Game/Robotics Application"

## Overview
This final project replaces the traditional exam, emphasizing the application of reinforcement learning (RL) concepts through collaborative or individual work. Students will develop a reinforcement learning agent that behaves ethically within a chosen environment, enhancing their understanding of the course objectives.

---

## Project Objectives
1. **Understanding of Fundamental Concepts**: Demonstrate knowledge of key RL terminologies and concepts.
2. **Application of Algorithms**: Implement selected reinforcement learning algorithms to solve a real-world problem.
3. **Evaluation and Analysis**: Apply and compare performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of the RL agent.
4. **Policy Design and Optimization**: Design a specific policy that achieves defined goals within a designated environment.
5. **Ethical Considerations**: Analyze and address ethical implications related to the project topic.
