    \frametitle{Case Context: Autonomous Vehicles Decision-Making}
    \begin{block}{Scenario}
        Consider an autonomous vehicle (AV) designed using reinforcement learning algorithms. This vehicle operates in complex urban environments and is tasked with making split-second decisions during critical situations, such as potential accidents.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Ethical Challenge}
        The AV must choose between two options when faced with an unavoidable crash scenario: 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Swerve to hit a pedestrian who unexpectedly crossed the road.
            \item Stay the course and collide with a barrier, endangering the passengers inside the vehicle.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Considerations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Moral Decision-Making:} 
        How should the AV weigh the value of human lives? Current RL algorithms may prioritize minimizing overall damage, but they may lack the nuanced understanding of moral values and social norms.
        
        \item \textbf{Data Bias:} 
        The training data used may not accurately represent diverse populations, leading to biased decision-making that disproportionately harms certain groups.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Implications}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Accountability:} Who is responsible for the decisions made by the AV? The developer, the manufacturer, or the vehicle itself?
        \item \textbf{Transparency:} How can the decision-making process be made understandable to stakeholders (drivers, pedestrians, city regulators)?
        \item \textbf{Trust:} How does the public's trust in autonomous systems change with the knowledge of such ethical dilemmas?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}

        \item Reinforcement learning can lead to decision-making frameworks that lack human-like ethical reasoning.
        \item The consequences of these decisions can have profound societal implications, affecting public safety and trust.
        \item To ensure ethical applications, developers must integrate safety protocols and ethical guidelines into the design and training of RL systems.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example of Ethical Algorithm Framework}
    \begin{block}{Decision Function Example}
        Let \( R \) represent the reward signal in an RL context: 
        \begin{equation}
            R = w_1 \cdot V_{\text{passenger}} - w_2 \cdot V_{\text{pedestrian}} 
        \end{equation}
        Where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( V_{\text{passenger}} \) is the value assigned to the safety of passengers,
            \item \( V_{\text{pedestrian}} \) is the safety of the pedestrian,
            \item \( w_1 \) and \( w_2 \) are weight factors representing the ethical considerations in the decision-making process.
        \end{itemize}
        This model illustrates how RL systems can be designed with weights reflecting societal values.
