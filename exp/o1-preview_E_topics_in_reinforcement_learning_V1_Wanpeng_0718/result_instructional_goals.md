Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

### Learning Objectives for "Topics in Reinforcement Learning"

1. **Understanding of Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals**
   - Students will define and differentiate key terminology in reinforcement learning (e.g., agents, environments, states, actions, rewards, policies) with at least 80% accuracy on assessments.

2. **Application of Algorithms**
   - Students will implement fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, DQN, Policy Gradient methods) to solve practical problems in domains such as gaming, robotics, and finance, achieving a minimum performance improvement of X% based on Y benchmark.

3. **Evaluation and Analysis**
   - Students will apply and compare at least three quantitative metrics (e.g., cumulative reward, learning curves, convergence rates) to assess and analyze the performance of reinforcement learning models.

4. **Policy Design and Optimization**
   - Students will design and optimize reinforcement learning policies in complex environments (e.g., simulated robotics) and demonstrate a X% increase in efficiency within those environments.

5. **Ethics and Implications of Reinforcement Learning**
   - Students will evaluate case studies and formulate position statements on ethical dilemmas associated with reinforcement learning applications, demonstrating an understanding of bias, accountability, and transparency.

6. **Research and Development Trends**
   - Students will critically review recent advancements in reinforcement learning research, including emerging methodologies and interdisciplinary applications, and analyze their implications for future developments in the field.

7. **Collaboration and Communication Skills**
   - Students will work collaboratively in teams to conduct projects and communicate their findings through written reports and oral presentations, receiving peer and instructor evaluations to enhance feedback and improvement.
