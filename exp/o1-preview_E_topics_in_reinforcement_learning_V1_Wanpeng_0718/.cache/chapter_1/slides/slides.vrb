\frametitle{Agents in RL - Summary and Formula}
    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Agents are central to RL systems; understanding their behavior is fundamental.
            \item The learning process involves balancing exploration and exploitation.
            \item The design and strategy of agents significantly affect learning efficiency and effectiveness.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Cumulative Reward Formula}
        The cumulative reward can be represented as:
        \begin{equation}
            G_t = R_t + \gamma R_{t+1} + \gamma^2 R_{t+2} + \ldots + \gamma^{n}R_{t+n}
        \end{equation}
        where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( G_t \): Cumulative reward at time \( t \)
            \item \( R \): Received rewards
            \item \( \gamma \) (0 â‰¤ \( \gamma \) < 1): Discount factor affecting the importance of future rewards.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
