    \frametitle{Common Evaluation Metrics}
    
    \begin{block}{Introduction to Evaluation Metrics in Reinforcement Learning (RL)}
        Understanding the performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) models is crucial for assessing their effectiveness and guiding enhancements. This slide introduces three widely-used quantitative metrics that help evaluate RL models:
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Cumulative Reward
        \item Learning Curves
        \item Convergence Rates
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Cumulative Reward}
    
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        The cumulative reward is the total reward accumulated by an agent over a certain period or number of episodes. It reflects the overall success of the agent in achieving its goals during training.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Formula}
        \begin{equation}
        R_t = \sum_{k=0}^{N} r_{t+k}
        \end{equation}
        where \( R_t \) is the cumulative reward from time \( t \), \( r_{t+k} \) is the reward received at time \( t+k \), and \( N \) is the number of time steps.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        If an agent earns rewards of 2, 3, and 1 over three time steps, the cumulative reward after three steps is \( R = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 \).
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Learning Curves and Convergence Rates}
    
    \begin{block}{Learning Curves}
        Learning curves represent the performance of an RL agent over time, typically plotted to show the cumulative reward or average reward per episode against the number of training episodes.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A learning curve can help visualize how quickly an agent is learning to maximize rewards.
            \item Steep slopes indicate rapid learning, while flat sections may signal plateaus or learning difficulties.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{block}{Example}
            A typical learning curve might show an agent's reward steadily increasing in the first 100 episodes, then plateauing as it reaches optimal performance, suggesting it is making fewer improvements.
        \end{block}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Convergence Rates}
        Convergence rates measure how quickly an RL algorithm approaches a stable policy or optimal solution, indicating the efficiency of the learning process.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Faster convergence implies that the agent learns efficiently with fewer training iterations.
            \item Factors influencing convergence include the algorithm used, reward structure, and complexity of the environment.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{block}{Example}
            If one algorithm converges to a stable policy after 200 episodes while another takes 500 episodes, the first algorithm has a faster convergence rate.
        \end{block}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Summary and Key Takeaway}
    
    \begin{block}{Summary}
        Evaluating RL models using cumulative reward, learning curves, and convergence rates is crucial for understanding their performance and improving their training. By applying these metrics, practitioners can make informed decisions on model adjustments and enhancements.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Takeaway}
        The choice and interpretation of evaluation metrics can significantly influence the development and understanding of RL systems, guiding designers toward effective solutions.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Next Slide Preview}
        We will delve deeper into Cumulative Reward and its implications for model performance.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Cumulative Reward - Introduction}
    \begin{block}{What is Cumulative Reward?}
        The \textbf{cumulative reward} is a crucial concept in reinforcement learning (RL) that quantifies the total reward an agent accumulates over time while interacting with the environment. It provides a holistic measure of the agent's performance and success in achieving its objectives.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Cumulative Reward - Mechanics}
    \begin{block}{How Cumulative Reward Works}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: The cumulative reward at a specific time step $t$ is the sum of all rewards $r_i$ received from the start of the episode until that time step:
            \begin{equation}
                R_t = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + ... + r_t
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Purpose}: This metric helps to evaluate how well an agent behaves in its environment. A higher cumulative reward indicates better performance, reflecting effective decision-making and successful action strategies.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Cumulative Reward - Key Points}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Temporal Dimension}: It considers the entire history of actions and rewards, encouraging the agent to prioritize longer-term outcomes over immediate gains.
        \item \textbf{Policy Evaluation}: Analyzing cumulative rewards through multiple episodes helps determine which policies yield the highest rewards, guiding improvements in the agent's learning.
        \item \textbf{Discounted Rewards}: Rewards are often discounted over time, emphasizing earlier rewards. This can be represented as:
        \begin{equation}
            R_t = r_1 + \gamma r_2 + \gamma^2 r_3 + ... + \gamma^{t-1} r_t
        \end{equation}
        Where $\gamma$ (gamma) is the discount factor (0 ≤ $\gamma$ < 1).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Cumulative Reward - Example}
    Consider an RL agent playing a game where it earns points (rewards) for reaching goals:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item At Time Step 1: Reward = 10
        \item At Time Step 2: Reward = 5
        \item At Time Step 3: Reward = 7
    \end{itemize}

    The cumulative reward would be:
    \begin{equation}
        R_t = 10 + 5 + 7 = 22
    \end{equation}

    If a discount factor $\gamma = 0.9$ were applied, the cumulative reward would be:
    \begin{equation}
        R_t \approx 10 + 0.9(5) + 0.9^2(7) \approx 20.17
    \end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Cumulative Reward - Importance and Conclusion}
    \begin{block}{Why is Cumulative Reward Important?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Enables comparison of different models, helping in selecting the best strategies.
            \item Highlights the efficiency of learning, showing how rewards are maximized over time.
            \item Serves as a foundational element for developing more complex evaluation metrics.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Conclusion}
        Cumulative reward is a fundamental metric that provides insight into an RL agent's effectiveness in achieving goals. Analyzing this metric helps fine-tune models and strategies for improved performance.
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Next Steps:} In the subsequent slide, we will delve into learning curves, which provide a visual representation of how an RL agent learns over time.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Learning Curves}
    \begin{block}{Understanding Learning Curves}
        Learning curves are graphical representations that illustrate the performance of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent over time or with experience.
        They depict how the cumulative reward or the chosen evaluation metric evolves as the agent interacts with the environment, providing insight into its learning progress.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Definition}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item A learning curve plots the performance metric (e.g., cumulative reward, average reward) on the y-axis against the number of training episodes or iterations on the x-axis.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Purpose}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Helps visualize how well the agent is learning. 
                \item Analyzing the shape of the curve can reveal trends such as improvement, stagnation, or overfitting.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example of a Learning Curve}
    \begin{block}{Scenario}
        Consider an RL agent that learns to play a game.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{X-axis}: Number of episodes (iterations).
        \item \textbf{Y-axis}: Average cumulative reward.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Expected Curve Behavior}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Initial Phase}: Erratic performance as the agent explores different strategies.
            \item \textbf{Learning Phase}: Noticeable upward trend in cumulative reward as the agent exploits successful strategies.
            \item \textbf{Plateau Phase}: Curve levels off, indicating that the agent has reached its performance potential for this task.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points}
    \begin{block}{Trend Analysis}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An upward trend typically indicates effective learning.
            \item A flat or downward trend may suggest the need for more training, adjustments in the algorithm, or changes in exploration-exploitation balance.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Benchmarking}
        Learning curves can be compared across different algorithms or hyperparameter settings to identify the most effective approaches in specific contexts.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Possible Formulas}
    The average cumulative reward can be calculated as follows:
    \begin{equation}
        R_t = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i
    \end{equation}
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( R_t \) = Average cumulative reward at time \( t \)
        \item \( n \) = Number of episodes
        \item \( r_i \) = Reward received in the \( i^{th} \) episode
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    Learning curves are essential tools for understanding the learning dynamics of RL agents. 
    By visualizing performance over time, researchers and practitioners can make informed decisions about training strategies, model adjustments, and exploration policies necessary for optimal learning.

        \item Discuss real-world applications of using learning curves in fine-tuning algorithms in fields like robotics, game AI, and autonomous systems.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Convergence Rates - Overview}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Convergence rates refer to the speed at which an algorithm approaches its optimal solution during training. In machine learning, especially in reinforcement learning (RL), a high convergence rate indicates efficient learning that reaches acceptable performance in fewer iterations.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Importance of Convergence Rates}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Efficiency of Training:} Faster convergence means fewer iterations for desired performance, resulting in lower computational costs.
            \item \textbf{Model Evaluation:} Helps assess the efficacy of algorithms or hyperparameters by comparing convergence times.
            \item \textbf{Stability \& Robustness:} Identifying oscillations in convergence can indicate issues in the learning process.

                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Exploration vs. Exploitation:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known information) affects convergence speed.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Algorithm Design:}
                \begin{itemize}

                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

            \item \textbf{Algorithm B:} Requires over 2000 episodes for similar performance.
        \end{itemize}
        This highlights the importance of selecting faster-converging algorithms for effective training.

            \item \textbf{Reinforcement Learning (RL)} is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.
            \item Evaluating an RL model is crucial to understand its performance and effectiveness, guiding future improvements and application in real-world scenarios.

    \frametitle{Key Evaluation Metrics in RL}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When assessing the performance of an RL model, several evaluation metrics can be employed. Here are some core metrics:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Cumulative Reward}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Definition}: Total sum of rewards received over a specific episode.
                \item \textbf{Formula}: 
                \begin{equation}
                    Cumulative\ Reward = \sum_{t=0}^{T} r_t
                \end{equation}
                \item \textbf{Example}: If an agent receives rewards of 1, -1, 2, and 3, the cumulative reward is \(1 + (-1) + 2 + 3 = 5\).
            \end{itemize}
