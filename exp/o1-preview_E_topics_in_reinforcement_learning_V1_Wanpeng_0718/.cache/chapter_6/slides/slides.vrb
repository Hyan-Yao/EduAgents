\frametitle{Cumulative Reward - Key Points}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Temporal Dimension}: It considers the entire history of actions and rewards, encouraging the agent to prioritize longer-term outcomes over immediate gains.
        \item \textbf{Policy Evaluation}: Analyzing cumulative rewards through multiple episodes helps determine which policies yield the highest rewards, guiding improvements in the agent's learning.
        \item \textbf{Discounted Rewards}: Rewards are often discounted over time, emphasizing earlier rewards. This can be represented as:
        \begin{equation}
            R_t = r_1 + \gamma r_2 + \gamma^2 r_3 + ... + \gamma^{t-1} r_t
        \end{equation}
        Where $\gamma$ (gamma) is the discount factor (0 â‰¤ $\gamma$ < 1).
    \end{enumerate}
