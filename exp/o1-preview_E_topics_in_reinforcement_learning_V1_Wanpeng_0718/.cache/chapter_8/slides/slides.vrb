    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{State (s)}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Definition}: A specific situation in the environment at a given time.
                \item \textbf{Example}: The position of a robot in a maze.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Action (a)}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Definition}: A move taken by the agent affecting the state.
                \item \textbf{Example}: Moving left or accelerating for a self-driving car.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Reward (r)}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Definition}: Feedback received from the environment as a result of an action.
                \item \textbf{Example}: A positive reward for reaching a destination; a penalty for hitting an obstacle.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Policy (Ï€)}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Definition}: A strategy that determines actions based on states.
                \item \textbf{Example}: A rule that states the robot should turn left when at a specific position.
            \end{itemize}
