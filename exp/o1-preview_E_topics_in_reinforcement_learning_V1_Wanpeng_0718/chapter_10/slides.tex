        Cumulative \ Reward = \sum_{t=1}^{N} R_t
    \end{equation}
    
    \textbf{Key Points:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item High cumulative reward indicates a well-performing policy.
        \item Useful for benchmarking different algorithms, especially in environments with delayed rewards.

    \textbf{Example:} Consider a maze-solving RL agent with the following rewards per time step:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Time step 1: +1
        \item Time step 2: -1
        \item Time step 3: +2
    \end{itemize}

    The cumulative reward would be:
    \begin{equation}
        Cumulative \ Reward = 1 + (-1) + 2 = 2
    \end{equation}

    \frametitle{Learning Curves}
    
    \textbf{Definition:} Learning curves graphically represent an agent's performance over time, showing the relationship between the number of training episodes and the performance metric (like cumulative reward or success rate).

    \textbf{Characteristics of Learning Curves:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Convergence:} Indicates if the learning process is reaching a stable performance level.
        \item \textbf{Variance:} Fluctuations in performance can suggest instability in learning.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Key Points:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A steep curve indicates rapid improvement; flattening suggests convergence.
        \item Helps in hyperparameter tuning by visualizing training duration against performance.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Diagram:} Imagine a graph with the X-axis representing the number of episodes (e.g., 0 to 1000) and the Y-axis representing cumulative reward. You would typically expect to see a rising curve that flattens as the model learns over time.
