            \item It includes states, possible actions, and rewards.
            \item The environment provides various states based on the actions taken by the agent.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Influence of States on Agent Behavior}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The agent perceives the current state to decide on actions based on its policy (strategy).
            \item Different states can lead to different actions, necessitating adaptation of agent behavior.
            \item Example: In chess, the state changes drastically with each move, requiring reevaluation of strategy.

                \item Each move results in a new state, changing decision-making.
            \end{itemize}
            
            \item \textbf{Example 2: Autonomous Driving}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The agent (self-driving car) observes states like traffic lights, other vehicles, and road conditions.
                \item The car makes decisions (accelerate, brake, turn) based on these states.

        In reinforcement learning (RL), an \textbf{action} is a decision made by an agent within the environment. The choice of action influences the future state and outcomes of the agent's experience.
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Types of Actions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Discrete Actions:} Limited set of possible actions (e.g., move left, move right).
            \item \textbf{Continuous Actions:} Infinite set of possible actions (e.g., steering angle in a car).

        \item \textbf{Reward Structure:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Positive Reward:} Indicates a desirable outcome (e.g., winning a game).
            \item \textbf{Negative Reward (Penalty):} Indicates an undesirable outcome (e.g., falling off a cliff).

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Maze:} If the agent successfully finds the exit, it receives a positive reward (+10). If it hits a wall, it receives a negative reward (-5).
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{The Interplay Between Actions and Rewards:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Actions lead to changes in state and subsequently receive rewards, forming the basis of learning:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Trial and Error:} The agent explores various actions to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
                \item \textbf{Learning Process:} Over many iterations, the agent learns which actions yield the highest rewards in specific states.
            \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Actions and Rewards - Key Equation and Points}
    \begin{block}{Key Equation}
        The agent's objective is to maximize the expected cumulative reward, often formulated as:
        \begin{equation}
            R = r(t) + \gamma r(t+1) + \gamma^2 r(t+2) + \ldots
        \end{equation}
        where \( R \) is the total expected reward, \( \gamma \) is the discount factor (0 â‰¤ \( \gamma \) < 1), and \( r(t) \) is the reward received at time \( t \).
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Points to Emphasize:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Actions directly impact the agent's learning process in RL.
            \item Rewards evaluate actions and reinforce learning through feedback, guiding agents toward optimal strategies.
            \item Understanding the dynamics between actions and rewards is essential for designing effective RL systems.
            \item By mastering actions and rewards, students gain better insight into policies in reinforcement learning.

    \begin{block}{Summary}
        A policy in reinforcement learning is crucial for guiding an agent's actions, impacting how agents interact with their environments and make decisions.

    \frametitle{Overview of the Reinforcement Learning Process}
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. The RL process involves several key components:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Agent}: The learner or decision-maker.
        \item \textbf{Environment}: The external system the agent interacts with.
        \item \textbf{State (s)}: Representation of the current situation.
        \item \textbf{Action (a)}: An operation taken by the agent.
        \item \textbf{Reward (r)}: Feedback from the environment.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{The RL Process}
    The RL process can be broken down into a series of steps:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Observation}: The agent observes the current state of the environment (s).
        \item \textbf{Decision Making}: The agent selects an action (a) based on its policy.
        \item \textbf{Action}: The agent performs the selected action (a).
        \item \textbf{Reward}: The agent receives a reward (r) based on the action taken.
        \item \textbf{Update Policy}: The agent updates its policy using the reward received.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Exploration vs. Exploitation}
    A critical aspect of RL is balancing exploration and exploitation:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploration}: Trying out new actions to discover effects and rewards.
        \item \textbf{Exploitation}: Leveraging known information to maximize short-term rewards.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The RL process is iterative and dynamic.
            \item A balance between exploration and exploitation is vital.
            \item Understanding this balance is crucial for effective learning algorithms.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Formula Representation}
    The agent's goal can be framed as maximizing future rewards, typically expressed through the concept of the value function:
    
    \begin{equation}
        V(s) = \max_{a} \left( r(s, a) + \gamma V(s') \right)
    \end{equation}
    
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( V(s) \) is the value of the state.
        \item \( r(s, a) \) is the immediate reward after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).
        \item \( \gamma \) is the discount factor (0 â‰¤ \( \gamma \) < 1).
        \item \( s' \) is the next state resulting from the action.
    \end{itemize}
    
    Understanding the RL process and the interplay between exploration and exploitation is fundamental to various applications, such as gaming and robotics.
