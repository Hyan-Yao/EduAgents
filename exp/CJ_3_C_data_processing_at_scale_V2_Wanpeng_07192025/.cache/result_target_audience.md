### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Modular Course Structure:**
   - Develop a differentiated instructional approach to cater to various student backgrounds, allowing engagement at different levels.

2. **Initial Skills Assessment:**
   - Conduct a pre-course skills assessment to tailor content effectively and identify students needing supplementary materials.

3. **Practical Labs/Flipped Classroom:**
   - Integrate practical labs and flipped classroom models to enhance hands-on application of theoretical knowledge.

4. **Ethical Scenario Introductions:**
   - Introduce ethical scenarios relevant to data processing through case studies for more immersive discussions on data governance.

5. **Team Building and Peer Evaluations:**
   - Include structured team-building exercises and peer evaluations to strengthen collaborative skills among students.

6. **Resource Accessibility Initiatives:**
   - Partner with IT departments to provide resources and ensure transparency about equipment and software requirements.

7. **Clear Syllabus Articulations:**
   - Clarify academic policies in the syllabus with explicit grading rubrics, late submission policies, and attendance requirements.

8. **Continuous Feedback Cycles:**
   - Establish formative assessments and student feedback opportunities for real-time teaching adjustments, fostering a culture of open communication.

By implementing these recommendations, the course can better engage students, facilitate skill acquisition, and enhance overall academic experiences and outcomes.
