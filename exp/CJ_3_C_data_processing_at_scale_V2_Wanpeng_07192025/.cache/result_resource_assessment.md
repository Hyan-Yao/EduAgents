Resource & Constraints Assessment
=================================

# Resource & Constraints Assessment for Course Delivery: "CJ_3_C: Data Processing at Scale"

## 1. Faculty Expertise Requirements
### Subject Matter Knowledge
- Faculty must possess in-depth knowledge of:
  - Data processing techniques
  - Data governance
  - Ethical considerations relevant to data management
- Background in data analytics and programming languages, particularly Python and R, is essential.

### Experience in Teaching
- Prior teaching experience in similar courses is crucial, especially in project-based learning, which requires skills in:
  - Collaboration
  - Team dynamics

### Assessment Proficiency
- Ability to develop assessments that adequately gauge the achievement of learning objectives.
- Capability of providing constructive feedback that aids in student learning.

## 2. Necessary Computing Resources
### Computer Equipment
- Each student should have access to:
  - High-performance computers (desktops in a lab setting or personal devices via BYOD).
  
### Network Infrastructure
- Reliable internet access is critical, necessitating:
  - High-speed internet to support online resources and heavy data usage.

## 3. Software Requirements
### Data Processing Platforms
- Essential software includes:
  - Jupyter Notebooks or RStudio for programming tasks.
  - SQL databases for data retrieval.
  - Data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).

### Licenses 
- Ensure that all required software is properly licensed and accessible to students, addressing licensing barriers.

### Data Accessibility
- Access to clean and relevant datasets is necessary for:
  - Assignments and practical experience.

## 4. Scheduling Constraints
### Class Timing and Duration
- Class scheduling must avoid:
  - Overlap with peak hour usage in computer labs to ensure availability of resources.

### Course Load Management
- Consideration of faculty and TA availability to balance teaching loads and ensure adequate student support.

## 5. Facility Limitations
### Space Requirements
- Classrooms and labs should accommodate:
  - The expected number of students enrolled, possibly requiring adaptation for larger classes.

### Technical Support Needs 
- Availability of IT support staff is essential:
  - To troubleshoot any technical issues that might arise during labs or lectures to minimize disruptions.

## 6. Additional Considerations
### Accessibility of Materials
- Course materials, including lecture notes and readings, should meet:
  - Accessibility standards for students with disabilities.

### Transparency in Academic Policies
- The course syllabus must clearly articulate:
  - Grading rubrics
  - Late policies
  - Attendance expectations
  - Assessment methods to uphold transparency and academic integrity principles.

### Acknowledgment of Prerequisites
- Communicate any prerequisites students must fulfill to ensure preparedness for coursework.

## Recommendations
### Faculty Development Opportunities
- Provide training or development workshops for instructors to enhance teaching methodologies, particularly in collaborative and project-based approaches.

### Feedback Mechanisms Implementation
- Develop structured feedback sessions throughout the course to monitor student engagement, understanding, and progress.

### Practical Examples
- Incorporate real-world case studies to help students understand the relevance of data processing techniques in contemporary contexts.

### Regular Assessments and Checkpoints
- Implement frequent low-stakes assessments to gauge student understanding, allowing timely interventions if necessary.

By assessing and addressing these resources and constraints thoughtfully, the course can be effectively positioned to achieve its outlined learning objectives and foster a supportive environment for student learning.
