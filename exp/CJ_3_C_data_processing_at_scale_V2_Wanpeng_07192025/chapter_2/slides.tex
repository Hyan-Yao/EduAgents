    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Ethical Considerations in Data Handling - Privacy Concerns}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: Privacy refers to the right of individuals to control their personal information and how it is collected, used, and shared.
        \item \textbf{Key Issues}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Unauthorized access to personal data can lead to identity theft and misuse.
                \item Surveillance technologies increase risks of invasion of privacy.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example}: A social media platform using users' data for targeted advertising without explicit consent can be deemed a violation of privacy.
