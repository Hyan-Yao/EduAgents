**Explanation:** Indexing frequently used columns can significantly speed up the performance of SQL queries.

**Question 2:** Which SQL clause is best used to limit the number of returned rows?

  A) WHERE
  B) GROUP BY
  C) LIMIT
  D) DISTINCT

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The LIMIT clause is used to specify the maximum number of records that the query will return, making it very useful for large datasets.

**Question 3:** Why should SELECT DISTINCT only be used when necessary?

  A) It is always required
  B) It can slow down query performance
  C) It makes queries easier to read
  D) It is mandatory for all queries

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Using SELECT DISTINCT can be resource-intensive since it requires additional processing to filter duplicate records.

**Question 4:** What should you consider when using subqueries?

  A) They are always faster than joins
  B) They can simplify complex queries
  C) They should replace all joins
  D) They are the only way to filter results

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** While subqueries can simplify complex logic, they can also impact performance. It's essential to evaluate if a JOIN could achieve the desired result more efficiently.
