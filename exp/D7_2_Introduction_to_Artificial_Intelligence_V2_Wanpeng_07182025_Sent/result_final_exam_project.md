# Final Project Plan: AI in Real-World Problem Solving

## Project Overview
Students will apply foundational AI concepts and techniques to address a specific real-world problem. This replaces the traditional final exam and includes structured milestones to encourage critical thinking, collaboration, and practical application of AI knowledge.

## Project Objectives
- Describe and apply foundational AI concepts (search strategies, logic reasoning, probabilistic models).
- Implement various AI algorithms (search algorithms, machine learning techniques) to solve real-world problems.
- Analyze the performance and ethical implications of chosen AI models.
- Foster teamwork and effective communication in project presentations.
