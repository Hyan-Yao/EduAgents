### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Introductory Workshops:** 
   - Host workshops at the beginning of the course focused on Python libraries and foundational AI concepts to standardize student preparedness.

2. **Supplemental Learning Materials:** 
   - Provide targeted resources such as short videos, reading materials, and interactive simulations for concepts like logic reasoning and search strategies.

3. **Peer Learning Initiatives:** 
   - Encourage group projects and study sessions for peer teaching, where stronger students assist peers struggling with content.

4. **Adaptive Learning Approaches:** 
   - Incorporate varied assessment methods (e.g., projects, collaborative work) to ensure practical application of knowledge rather than relying solely on traditional exams.

5. **Continuous Feedback Mechanism:** 
   - Regularly collect anonymous student feedback to adjust pacing and clarify points of confusion, especially early in the term.

6. **Interactive Learning Labs:** 
   - Facilitate hands-on labs that allow students to engage with AI tools, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with practical applications.

7. **Language Support Resources:** 
   - Develop a resource guide with key terms and example problems for non-native speakers to enhance comprehension.

8. **Math Review Sessions:** 
   - Offer optional review classes on probability and discrete mathematics early in the course to better equip students for advanced topics.

9. **Diverse Assessment Methods:** 
   - Implement project-based assessments, peer reviews, and reflective essays to cater to different learning styles and reduce pressure from exams.

10. **Clear Communication of Expectations:** 
   - Provide detailed grading rubrics and examples of successful projects to align students with course goals from the start.
