\frametitle{Discussion Questions and Conclusion}
  To kick off our discussion, consider these questions:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What are some real-world applications of reinforcement learning you think could benefit from exploration strategies?
    \item How might the balance between exploration and exploitation manifest in a gambling scenario?
    \item Can you think of a situation where reinforcement learning could fail or lead to suboptimal results?
  \end{enumerate}

  \textbf{Emphasizing Key Points:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Encouraging open dialogue will help reinforce understanding of RL principles.
    \item Clarification of concepts such as policies, value functions, and the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial.
    \item Remember, all questions are valid, and there's no such thing as a silly question!
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Interactive Activity:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Quick Poll:} What part of reinforcement learning do you find most challenging? (Options: Definitions, Algorithms, Applications, Other)
  \end{itemize}

  Utilizing this time for questions and discussions is essential for deepening your understanding of reinforcement learning. Let's dive in and clarify what's on your mind!
