  B) Unsupervised Learning
  C) Reinforced Learning
  D) Structured Learning

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Structured Learning is not recognized as a standard type of Machine Learning, whereas Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning are commonly acknowledged.

**Question 3:** What is overfitting in the context of Machine Learning?

  A) When a model performs well on test data but poorly on training data
  B) When a model captures noise and performs poorly on new data
  C) When a model fails to capture trends in the training data
  D) When a model is too simple for the data

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise from the training data rather than the underlying distribution, leading to poor performance on unseen data.

**Question 4:** Which of the following metrics is used to evaluate Machine Learning model performance?

  A) Profit margin
  B) Accuracy
  C) Number of features
  D) Amount of data

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Accuracy is a common evaluation metric for assessing how well a Machine Learning model performs by measuring the proportion of correct predictions.

### Activities
- In groups, discuss real-world examples of Machine Learning applications and their impacts. Prepare a brief presentation for the class.

### Discussion Questions
- Can you think of a real-life application of Reinforcement Learning? How does it compare to Supervised or Unsupervised Learning?
- What challenges do you think arise when implementing Machine Learning solutions in industries like healthcare or finance?
