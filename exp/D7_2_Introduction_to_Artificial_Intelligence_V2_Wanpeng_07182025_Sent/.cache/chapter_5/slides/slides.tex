            \item Simplicity: Quick responses to environmental changes.
            \item Low Computational Requirement: Minimal processing; no need to plan or deliberate.
            \item Stimulus-Response: Actions based on predefined rules or condition-action pairs.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Examples:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Autonomous Robots: Basic obstacle avoidance using sensors.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reactive Layer: Interprets voice commands (e.g., “Turn on the lights”).
            \item Deliberative Layer: Searches the web or accesses calendars for complex queries.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Key Points to Remember:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reactive Agents: Best suited for fast and straightforward tasks.
