    \frametitle{Formula Insights}
    \begin{equation}
        EU = \sum (P(x_i) \times U(x_i))
    \end{equation}
    Where \(EU\) is expected utility, \(P(x_i)\) is the probability of outcome \(x_i\), and \(U(x_i)\) is the utility of outcome \(x_i\). This formula aids in maximizing expected outcomes based on probabilistic assessments.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Markov Decision Processes (MDP)}
    \begin{block}{What is an MDP?}
        A \textbf{Markov Decision Process (MDP)} is a mathematical framework used to model decision-making situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Components of MDPs}
    An MDP is defined by the following components:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{States (S)}: A finite set of states representing all possible situations for the decision-maker.  
        \item \textbf{Actions (A)}: A finite set of actions available in each state.
        \item \textbf{Transition Model (P)}: The probability of moving from one state to another given an action, denoted by \( P(s' | s, a) \).
        \item \textbf{Rewards (R)}: A function \( R(s, a, s') \) providing feedback after transitioning between states.
        \item \textbf{Discount Factor ($\gamma$)}: A value between 0 and 1 representing the importance of future rewards.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{How MDPs Work and Example}
    MDPs guide decision-making through \textbf{policies}, which dictate actions in each state.
    The goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes expected rewards, using the \textbf{value function} defined by:
    \begin{equation}
        V(s) = \max_a \sum_{s'} P(s' | s, a) [R(s, a, s') + \gamma V(s')]
    \end{equation}

    \textbf{Example}: A robot navigating a 2x2 grid:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{States}: Positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)
        \item \textbf{Actions}: Move Up, Down, Left, Right
        \item \textbf{Reward}: +10 for reaching (1,1), -1 otherwise
        \item \textbf{Transition Probabilities}: 70\% chance to move successfully, 30\% chance to slip.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion and Key Points}
    Markov Decision Processes are crucial for modeling decision-making in uncertain environments. Key points to remember:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MDPs model decisions leading to random outcomes.
        \item Components: States, Actions, Transition Models, Rewards, Discount Factor.
        \item Aim: Identify an optimal policy that maximizes expected rewards.
    \end{itemize}
    MDPs are essential in fields like robotics, economics, and AI.
