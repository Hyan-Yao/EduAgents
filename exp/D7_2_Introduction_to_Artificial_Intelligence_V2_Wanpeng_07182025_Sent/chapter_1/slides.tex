    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Search Strategies}
    \textbf{Definition}: Search strategies are methods used by AI agents to explore possible configurations in a problem space to find solutions.

    \begin{block}{Types of Search Strategies}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Uninformed Search} (Blind search)
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Breadth-First Search (BFS)}: Explores all nodes at the present depth before moving onto nodes at the next depth level.
                \item \textbf{Depth-First Search (DFS)}: Explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Informed Search}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{A* Search Algorithm}: Combines the benefits of BFS and heuristic search, evaluating nodes using the cost function \(f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\).

  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Common Uninformed Search Algorithms}:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Breadth-First Search (BFS)}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next depth level.
        \item \textbf{Example}: Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: Guarantees the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.
      \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Depth-First Search (DFS)}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.
        \item \textbf{Example}: Solving puzzles like mazes.
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: Can be more memory efficient than BFS.
      \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Uniform Cost Search (UCS)}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Similar to BFS but considers path costs to determine the most promising node.
        \item \textbf{Example}: Finding the least expensive route in weighted graphs.
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: Guarantees an optimal solution based on path cost.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Informed Search Strategies}
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    Informed search strategies (heuristic search) utilize domain-specific knowledge to make efficient decisions on which nodes to explore.
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Common Informed Search Algorithms}:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{A* Search}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Combines features of UCS and BFS using a cost function that considers both distance from the start node and an estimated cost to the goal.
        \item \textbf{Example}: Pathfinding in navigation systems (e.g., Google Maps).
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: A* is optimal when the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the cost).
      \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Greedy Best-First Search}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Selects the node that appears closest to the goal based on a heuristic.
        \item \textbf{Example}: Simple AI players in games.
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: Not guaranteed to find the optimal solution.
      \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Hill Climbing}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item A local search algorithm that continuously moves toward the steepest ascent until no improvements can be found.
        \item \textbf{Example}: Optimizing function parameters in machine learning.
        \item \textbf{Key Point}: Prone to getting stuck in local maxima.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Summary of Search Strategies}
  \begin{block}{Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Uninformed Strategies}: BFS, DFS, UCS – Systematic exploration, no heuristics.
      \item \textbf{Informed Strategies}: A*, Greedy BFS, Hill Climbing – Use heuristics for efficiency.

  \begin{block}{Overview of Agent Architectures}
    Agent architectures are frameworks that define how intelligent agents perceive their environment, make decisions, and act upon it. Understanding different agent architectures is crucial for designing systems that can effectively interact with their surroundings.
  \end{block}
  We will explore three primary types of agent architectures:

  \frametitle{Markov Decision Processes}
  Introduction to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and their role in decision-making.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Introduction to MDPs}
  Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker (the agent). MDPs are widely used in various fields, including robotics, economics, and AI, particularly in reinforcement learning.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Components of an MDP}
  An MDP is defined by five key components:
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{States (S)}: Set of all possible situations the agent may encounter.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Example: Each position in a maze.
          \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Actions (A)}: Set of actions the agent can take to change its state.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Example: Moving up, down, left, or right in a maze.
          \end{itemize}
          
      \item \textbf{Transition Probability (P)}: Probability of moving from one state to another after an action.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Notation: $P(s'|s,a)$ represents the probability of reaching state $s'$ from state $s$ using action $a$.
              \item Example: 0.9 probability of moving up successfully vs. 0.1 probability of slipping back.
          \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Reward Function (R)}: Function providing feedback via numerical rewards for actions.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Example: Reward of +10 for reaching a goal state, -1 for hitting a wall.
          \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Discount Factor ($\gamma$)}: A value (0 to 1) that represents the present value of future rewards, emphasizing the balance between immediate and delayed rewards.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Higher $\gamma$ values future rewards more; lower $\gamma$ prioritizes immediate gains.
          \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Decision-Making in MDPs}
  The goal in an MDP is to find a policy ($\pi$) mapping states to actions, maximizing the expected sum of rewards over time:
  \begin{equation}
  V^\pi(s) = \sum_{a \in A} \pi(a|s) \sum_{s' \in S} P(s'|s,a) [R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^\pi(s')]
  \end{equation}

  \begin{itemize}
      \item $V^\pi(s)$ is the value function estimating expected return from state $s$ following policy $\pi$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Points and Applications}
  \begin{block}{Key Points}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Memoryless Property (Markov Property)}: Future states depend only on the current state and action.
          \item \textbf{Optimal Policy}: The policy that yields the highest expected return.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Applications of MDPs}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Robotics}: Navigating environments.

  \begin{block}{Definition}
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions through interactions with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

  \begin{block}{Key Components}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Agent:} The learner or decision-maker.
      \item \textbf{Environment:} Everything the agent interacts with.
      \item \textbf{Actions (A):} Choices made by the agent.

      \item \textbf{Reward (R):} Feedback from the environment.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Reinforcement Learning - How It Works}
  \begin{block}{Process Cycle}
    The RL process can be summarized in the following cycle:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The agent observes its current state (S).
      \item It selects an action (A) based on a policy (π).
      \item The environment responds, transitioning to a new state (S') and providing a reward (R).
      \item The agent updates its policy based on the received reward.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{block}{Mathematical Formulation}
    The goal is to learn a policy \( \pi \) that maximizes expected rewards:
    \begin{equation}
    G_t = R_t + \gamma R_{t+1} + \gamma^2 R_{t+2} + ... 
    \end{equation}
    where \( 0 \leq \gamma < 1 \) is the discount factor.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Reinforcement Learning - Types and Applications}
  \begin{block}{Types of Reinforcement Learning}
    \begin{itemize}

          \item **SARSA:** On-policy learning updating based on the action actually taken.
        \end{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Model-Based:} Builds a model of the environment for planning.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{block}{Applications}
    Examples include:
