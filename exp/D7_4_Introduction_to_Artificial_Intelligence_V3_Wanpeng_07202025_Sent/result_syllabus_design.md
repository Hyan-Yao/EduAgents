## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence (AI). Students will explore key AI principles, including search strategies, logic reasoning, probabilistic models, and the basics of machine learning. The course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and hands-on practical application through coding assignments and projects. Ethical implications and responsible AI practices will also be discussed.

## Course Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Understand core AI concepts including search strategies, logic reasoning, and probabilistic models.
2. Apply algorithms for search, planning, decision making, and learning.
3. Solve AI problems using techniques such as Markov Decision Processes and reinforcement learning.
4. Analyze AI models for correctness, performance, and applicability.
5. Evaluate AI systems considering ethical implications and promote responsible AI development.
