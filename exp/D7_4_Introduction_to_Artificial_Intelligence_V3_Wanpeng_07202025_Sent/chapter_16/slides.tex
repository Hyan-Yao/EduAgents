                \item \textbf{Depth-First Search (DFS):} Explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Informed Search:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{A* Search:} Combines heuristic and path cost information using the evaluation function
                \begin{equation}
                    f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item $g(n)$ = cost from start to node $n$
                    \item $h(n)$ = heuristic estimated cost from node $n$ to the goal.

    \frametitle{Machine Learning Fundamentals Review}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        In this slide, we will review the essential principles of supervised and unsupervised learning, two foundational approaches in machine learning. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting the appropriate algorithm and method based on your data and objectives.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Supervised Learning}

    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. This means that for every input feature, there is a corresponding output label.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Characteristics:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Labeled Data: Requires a dataset where the target variable is known.
            \item Goal: Learn a mapping from inputs to outputs for predictions on unseen data.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Common Algorithms:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Linear Regression: Predicts a continuous target variable (e.g., House prices).
            \item Decision Trees: Useful for both classification and regression (e.g., Email classification).
            \item Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective for high-dimensional spaces (e.g., Image recognition).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example: Supervised Learning}

    \begin{block}{Illustration}
        \textbf{Task:} Given a dataset of students with features like study hours, attendance, and previous grades (input), the model could predict their final exam scores (output).
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Unsupervised Learning}

    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Unsupervised learning refers to machine learning where the model is trained on data without labeled responses. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Key Characteristics:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unlabeled Data: Does not require labels for training data.
            \item Goal: Identify patterns, group similar data points, or reduce dimensionality.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Common Algorithms:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item K-Means Clustering: Groups data into K distinct clusters (e.g., Market segmentation).
            \item Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a tree of clusters (e.g., Document organization).
            \item Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces dimensionality (e.g., Image simplification).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example: Unsupervised Learning}

    \begin{block}{Illustration}
        \textbf{Task:} Given customer data without any labels, the algorithm may reveal groups of customers based on buying habits or preferences.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Points to Emphasize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Labeled vs. Unlabeled: Main distinction lies in availability of labeled data.
        \item Model Purpose: Supervised learning focuses on prediction, unsupervised learning on discovering patterns.
        \item Applications: Supervised learning is for known outcomes; unsupervised is for exploratory data analysis.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Summary}

    Understanding the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning is vital for effectively applying machine learning techniques. Supervised learning focuses on prediction with labeled data, while unsupervised learning aims to identify patterns within unlabeled data. Always select the method that aligns best with your data characteristics and goals.
