### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the primary purpose of an activation function in a neural network?

  A) To initialize weights
  B) To introduce non-linearity into the model
  C) To determine the output size
  D) To optimize the learning rate

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Activation functions introduce non-linearity into neural networks, allowing them to learn complex patterns.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is a method to prevent overfitting in deep learning models?

  A) Increasing the size of the dataset
  B) Reducing the number of layers
  C) Using dropout layers
  D) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** All these methods can help reduce overfitting: increasing dataset size, reducing layers, and using dropout layers.

**Question 3:** What type of neural network is best suited for image recognition tasks?

  A) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
  B) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  C) Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
  D) Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specifically designed to process and recognize patterns in image data.

**Question 4:** Which cost function is typically used for binary classification problems in neural networks?

  A) Mean Squared Error
  B) Cross-Entropy Loss
  C) Hinge Loss
  D) Kullback-Leibler Divergence

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Cross-Entropy Loss is commonly used for measuring the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1.

**Question 5:** Which is NOT a type of neural network?

  A) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  B) Deep Belief Network (DBN)
  C) Decision Tree Network
  D) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Decision Trees are not a type of neural network. They are a different type of machine learning algorithm.
