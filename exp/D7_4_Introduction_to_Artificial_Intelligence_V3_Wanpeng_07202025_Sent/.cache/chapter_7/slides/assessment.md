  B) Indicates that a property holds true for all elements.
  C) Denotes a specific instance of an object.
  D) Represents a logical disjunction.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The universal quantifier (∀) asserts that a property holds for all elements in a given domain.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is an example of a predicate in First-Order Logic?

  A) John
  B) Loves
  C) ∀x
  D) (Loves(John, Mary))

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** A predicate like 'Loves' represents a property or relationship between objects, as in 'Loves(John, Mary)'.

**Question 3:** What does the existential quantifier (∃) signify in FOL?

  A) All objects satisfy a condition.
  B) There exists at least one object that satisfies a condition.
  C) A statement is true for some objects but not all.
  D) A logical contradiction exists.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The existential quantifier (∃) indicates that there is at least one element in the domain for which the property holds true.

**Question 4:** Which inference rule allows for concluding 'Q' from 'P → Q' and 'P'?

  A) Modus Tollens
  B) Modus Ponens
  C) Resolution
  D) Induction

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Modus Ponens is the inference rule that allows us to conclude 'Q' if we have 'P → Q' (If P then Q) and 'P' is true.

### Activities
- Compose a written reflection summarizing the concepts learned about first-order logic and how it compares to propositional logic.
- Create an example of a statement that uses both a universal and an existential quantifier in First-Order Logic.

### Discussion Questions
- How does First-Order Logic improve upon propositional logic in expressing relationships and properties?
- Can you think of a practical application of first-order logic in real-world scenarios? Discuss.

## Section 16: Q&A Session

### Learning Objectives
- Facilitate a deeper understanding of the material through discussion.
- Clarify any uncertainties regarding first-order logic and its applications.
- Encourage students to apply first-order logic in practical scenarios.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What does the universal quantifier (∀) signify in first-order logic?

  A) There exists at least one element in a domain
  B) A property holds for all elements in a domain
  C) A property is true for none of the elements
  D) The relationship is inconsistent

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The universal quantifier (∀) states that the statement it precedes holds for every element within a specified domain.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is a correct representation of the statement 'There exists at least one black cat'?

  A) ∀x (Cat(x) ∨ Black(x))
  B) ∃y (Cat(y) ∧ Black(y))
  C) ∀y (Cat(y) ∧ Black(y))
  D) ∅(x)

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The existential quantifier (∃) confirms that there is at least one instance of `y` such that `y` is both a cat and black.

**Question 3:** In first-order logic, which of the following statements is true regarding predicates?

  A) They can only take true or false values.
  B) They are always quantifiable.
  C) They apply only to constants.
  D) They can only be part of universal quantifiers.

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Predicates in first-order logic are functions that return binary truth values—true or false—based on the variables they hold.

**Question 4:** What distinguishes first-order logic from propositional logic?

  A) FOL does not use quantifiers while propositional logic does.
  B) FOL can express relationships and properties about objects, while propositional logic cannot.
  C) FOL only handles true or false statements.
  D) FOL has a simpler syntax than propositional logic.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** First-order logic extends propositional logic by allowing the expression of relationships and properties about objects through the use of predicates and quantifiers.

### Activities
- Group activity: In small groups, create a first-order logic statement for the scenario 'Every teacher teaches at least one subject.' Then, discuss how this can be applied in knowledge representation.

### Discussion Questions
- How can first-order logic be used to represent real-world scenarios, and what are its limitations?
- In what ways does the complexity of first-order logic enhance or hinder its applicability in fields like artificial intelligence?
- Compare and contrast the expressiveness of first-order logic with propositional logic and other logical systems.
