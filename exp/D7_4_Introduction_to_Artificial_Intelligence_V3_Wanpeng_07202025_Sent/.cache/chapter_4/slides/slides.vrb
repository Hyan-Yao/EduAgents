\frametitle{Concept of a Constraint Graph}
    A \textbf{constraint graph} is a visual representation used to depict the variables and constraints of a CSP:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Nodes}: Each node represents a variable in the CSP.
        \item \textbf{Edges}: Each edge connects variables that are directly constrained by a specific relationship (constraint).
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Consider three variables \(X_1, X_2, X_3\) with the following constraints:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) are constrained (e.g., \(X_1 + X_2 \leq 10\)).
            \item \(X_2\) and \(X_3\) are constrained (e.g., \(X_2 + X_3 = 5\)).
        \end{itemize}
        Graphically, it can be represented as:
        \begin{equation*}
            \text{   } X_1 \\
            \text{    |} \\
            \text{    |} \\
            \text{   } X_2 \text{ -- } X_3
        \end{equation*}
    \end{block}
