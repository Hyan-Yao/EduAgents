  A) AND (∧)
  B) OR (∨)
  C) NOT (¬)
  D) THEN (→)

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** THEN (→) is not a basic logical connective in propositional logic; it is a part of implication in more complex logical systems.

**Question 3:** In a truth table, what does a 'T' represent?

  A) True
  B) Tautology

  A) Affirms the proposition
  B) Negates the truth value of the proposition
  C) Combines two propositions
  D) Is irrelevant to propositional logic

  A) Modus Ponens
  B) Modus Tollens
  C) Disjunctive Syllogism
  D) Hypothetical Syllogism

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Modus Ponens is the rule that if P implies Q and P is true, Q must also be true.

**Question 2:** Which inference method allows you to conclude that P is false if Q is false?

  A) Modus Ponens
  B) Modus Tollens
  C) Affirming the Consequent
  D) Disjunctive Syllogism

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Modus Tollens allows us to conclude that if the consequent Q is false, then the antecedent P must also be false.

**Question 3:** Given the premises: 'If it is sunny, then I will go for a walk' and 'I did not go for a walk', what can you conclude?

  A) It is sunny.
  B) It is not sunny.
  C) It is raining.
  D) I will stay indoors.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Using Modus Tollens, since the consequent (going for a walk) is false, we conclude the antecedent (it is sunny) must also be false.

**Question 4:** Which of the following statements demonstrates Modus Ponens?

  A) If I study hard, then I will pass the exam. I did not pass the exam, therefore I did not study hard.
  B) If I set my alarm, I will wake up. I set my alarm, therefore I will wake up.
  C) If it snows, then the streets will be slippery. The streets are slippery, therefore it has snowed.
  D) If I eat too much, I will feel sick. I feel sick, therefore I ate too much.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** In statement B, the structure follows Modus Ponens since if P (set my alarm) is true, then Q (I will wake up) must also be true.

### Activities
- Create your own conditional statements and apply Modus Ponens and Modus Tollens to derive conclusions. Share your findings with the class.
- In pairs, present real-world examples that can be analyzed using the methods of Modus Ponens and Modus Tollens, and discuss the validity of the conclusions drawn.

  A) Modus Tollens
  B) Disjunctive Syllogism
  C) Modus Ponens
  D) Constructive Dilemma

**Correct Answer:** C

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** 'AND' ( ∧ ) means the combined statement is true only if both individual statements are true.

**Question 3:** How many total rows would be in a truth table for two propositions (A and B)?

  A) 2
  B) 4
  C) 8
  D) 3

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** For two propositions, the truth table contains 2^2 = 4 rows, covering all combinations of true and false.

**Question 4:** What is the result of the expression 'NOT (A AND B)' when A is true and B is false?

  A) True
  B) False
  C) Undefined
  D) Depends on A

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** The expression evaluates to 'NOT (True AND False)' which simplifies to 'NOT (False)', resulting in True.

### Activities
- Have students create their own truth tables for combinations of propositions A, B, and C, analyzing the results.
- Encourage students to form pairs and explain the significance of logical connectives through examples.

### Discussion Questions
- What are some real-world applications of propositional logic in AI and machine learning?
- Can you provide examples of compound statements where the truth is not easily determined?
- How might different logical connectives affect the arguments in decision-making scenarios?
