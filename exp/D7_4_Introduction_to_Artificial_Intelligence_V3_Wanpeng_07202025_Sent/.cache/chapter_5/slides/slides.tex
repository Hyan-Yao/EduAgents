    \frametitle{Key Concepts}

    \begin{block}{Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: A multi-agent system consists of multiple interacting intelligent agents, which can be machines, software programs, or humans. Each agent operates autonomously, collaborating or competing with others to achieve specific goals.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Characteristics}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Autonomy}: Agents can make decisions independently.
            \item \textbf{Interaction}: Agents communicate and operate in shared environments.
            \item \textbf{Decentralization}: No central control; agents operate based on local information and personal objectives.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Significance in AI and Game Playing}

            \item Complex environments (e.g., robotic swarms, resource management).
            \item Decision-making that requires negotiation and cooperation (e.g., team-based AI).
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Game Playing as an Example of MAS}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Game Theory examines strategic interactions among rational agents.
            \item Important examples:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Chess}: Players anticipate each other's moves in a zero-sum game.
                \item \textbf{Cooperative Games}: Illustrates trust and betrayal, like in “The Prisoner's Dilemma.”
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Conclusion:} Understanding multi-agent systems enriches AI development, providing insights into strategic decision-making.

    \frametitle{Types of Games - Overview}
    % Understanding Game Types in Game Theory
    Game theory provides a framework for analyzing competitive situations where the outcome for each participant depends on the decisions of both themselves and others. 
    In this section, we’ll explore three major classifications of games:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cooperative vs. Non-Cooperative
        \item Zero-Sum vs. Non-Zero-Sum
        \item Deterministic vs. Stochastic
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Games - Cooperative vs. Non-Cooperative}
    \begin{block}{Cooperative Games}
        Players can form binding commitments and agreements to coordinate strategies. The focus is on maximizing total payoffs.
        
        \textbf{Example:} Companies forming a cartel to set prices and maximizing shared profits.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Non-Cooperative Games}
        Players act independently without the ability to enforce agreements, optimizing individual outcomes.
        
        \textbf{Example:} Companies deciding on pricing independently in a competitive market.
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Key Point:} The distinction lies in the ability to enforce agreements and collaborate.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Games - Zero-Sum vs. Non-Zero-Sum}
    \begin{block}{Zero-Sum Games}
        One player's gain is balanced by the losses of others, keeping total utility constant (zero).
        
        \textbf{Example:} In poker, if one player wins \$100, that amount comes from the others' losses.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Non-Zero-Sum Games}
        All players can either benefit or lose; total gains and losses vary.
        
        \textbf{Example:} Trade agreements that lead to mutual benefits for both countries involved.
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Key Point:} Understanding the zero-sum vs. non-zero-sum distinction helps in strategizing.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Types of Games - Deterministic vs. Stochastic}
    \begin{block}{Deterministic Games}
        Outcomes are determined by initial conditions and strategies without randomness.
        
        \textbf{Example:} Chess, where moves lead to predictable results.
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Stochastic Games}
        Incorporate random elements affecting outcomes alongside players' decisions.
        
        \textbf{Example:} Monopoly, where dice rolls introduce randomness to the game dynamics.
    \end{block}

    \textbf{Key Point:} The difference between deterministic and stochastic games is essential for strategic planning.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Summary and Conclusion}
    In summary, knowing the types of games in game theory enables effective strategic decision-making. 
    Recognizing whether a game is:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cooperative or Non-Cooperative
        \item Zero-Sum or Non-Zero-Sum
        \item Deterministic or Stochastic
    \end{itemize}
    facilitates better strategies and anticipates opponent behavior in various scenarios, important in fields like economics, politics, and artificial intelligence.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Adversarial Search - Introduction}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Adversarial search is a crucial AI component in game playing, where agents compete, each aiming to maximize their advantage while minimizing that of their opponents.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Significance}
        This search strategy is essential for navigating competitive environments, requiring players to think strategically and anticipate moves.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Adversarial Search - Game Playing}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Optimal Play:} Identifying the best sequence of moves for victory, assuming the opponent also plays optimally.
        \item \textbf{Minimax Principle:} Players maximize their minimum gain; a fundamental component of adversarial strategy.
        \item \textbf{Game Trees:} Visual representation of potential game states, where nodes represent states and edges represent moves.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Adversarial Search - Examples}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Chess:} Players must consider multiple moves, balancing their piece development against the opponent's strategy.
        \item \textbf{Checkers:} The goal is to capture all pieces; evaluation of moves is necessary to block the opponent while optimizing positioning.
        \item \textbf{Tic-Tac-Toe:} A foundational example of adversarial search utilizing blocking and winning strategies.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Adversarial Search - Algorithms}
    \begin{block}{Minimax Algorithm}
        The fundamental operation can be represented as:
        \begin{equation}
        \text{Value}(node) = \begin{cases} 
        \text{Value}(child) & \text{if it's max player's turn} \\ 
        \text{Value}(child) & \text{if it's min player's turn} 
        \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
    \end{block}

            \item Grasp the concept of decision-making in adversarial games using Minimax.

        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Introduction to Minimax}
    The Minimax algorithm is a decision rule used for minimizing the possible loss while maximizing the potential gain. It is commonly used in zero-sum games where one player's gain is another player's loss.

    \begin{block}{Basic Principles}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Maximizer}: The player aiming to maximize their score (Player 1).
            \item \textbf{Minimizer}: The opponent trying to minimize the score of the maximizer (Player 2).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    The algorithm evaluates possible moves, assigns scores to game states, and selects the move that yields the best outcome for the maximizer while anticipating the best moves from the minimizer.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Practical Example: Tic-Tac-Toe}
    Consider a simplified Tic-Tac-Toe game where Player 1 (Maximizer) is 'X' and Player 2 (Minimizer) is 'O'. The current state of the game looks as follows:

    \begin{verbatim}
     X | O |  
    -----------
       | X | O
    -----------
       |   |  
    \end{verbatim}

    \begin{block}{Game Tree Overview}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Root Node}: Current state of the game.
            \item \textbf{Child Nodes}: Possible moves for 'X' and 'O'.
            \item \textbf{Leaf Nodes}: Terminal states, with scores assigned (+1 for win, 0 for draw, -1 for lose).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Step-by-Step Walkthrough}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Identify Valid Moves}: Player 1 can place 'X' in positions (2, 0), (2, 1), or (2, 2).
        \item \textbf{Generate the Game Tree}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item For each valid move, simulate Player 2's response.
                \item Continue this process until the game reaches terminal states.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Assign Scores}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Win for 'X':} +1
                \item \textbf{Lose for 'O':} -1
                \item \textbf{Draw:} 0
            \end{itemize}
            Below is a simplified score assignment for each terminal state:
            \begin{verbatim}
              Move          Result
            - (2, 0): Win   -> +1
            - (2, 1): Draw  -> 0
            - (2, 2): Lose  -> -1
            \end{verbatim}
        \item \textbf{Backtrack to Calculate Minimax Values}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item For each of Player 2's moves, select the minimum score.
                \item For Player 1, select the maximum of these minimum scores.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Optimal Move Selection}
    After backtracking, choose the move leading to the highest score for 'X', considering Player 2 will also play optimally.

    Example scores:
    \begin{verbatim}
                          [ X ]
                         /     \
                      Min      Min
                    / | \     / | \
                  +1  0  -1  +1  0  -1
    \end{verbatim}

    \begin{block}{Key Points to Emphasize}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Optimal Play}: The Minimax algorithm ensures that both players play optimally.
            \item \textbf{Recursion in Search Tree}: The recursive nature allows for systematic exploration of all possible game outcomes.
            \item \textbf{Time Complexity}: The algorithm's complexity is \(O(b^d)\) where:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \(b\) is the branching factor (average number of moves per player),
                \item \(d\) is the depth of the tree (number of levels to explore).
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    By applying the Minimax algorithm, Player 1 can ensure they choose the optimal move to either win or draw, while preparing against Player 2's strategies.

    \frametitle{Introduction to Minimax Algorithm}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        The Minimax algorithm is a recursive strategy used for decision-making and game theory. It aims to minimize the possible loss in a worst-case scenario for a player.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Key Concepts}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Game Tree:} A structure representing all possible moves and outcomes.
            \item \textbf{Min Level:} The opponent's level minimizing the Max player's score.
            \item \textbf{Max Level:} The player's level maximizing their score.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Example}
        Consider a simple game where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Max:} Chooses between moves leading to scores of 3, 5, and 2.
            \item \textbf{Min:} Chooses between 3 and 7 when faced with Max’s options.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \textbf{Game Tree:}
        \begin{verbatim}
                Max
               / | \
              3  5  2
                   |
                  Min
                  / \
                 3   7
        \end{verbatim}
        
        \textbf{Max chooses 5, Min chooses 3. The result: Minimax value = 3.}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Understanding Alpha-Beta Pruning}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Alpha-Beta pruning optimizes the Minimax algorithm by "pruning" branches in the game tree that will not affect the final decision, effectively reducing the number of nodes evaluated.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Key Concepts}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Alpha:} The best already explored option for the maximizer.
            \item \textbf{Beta:} The best already explored option for the minimizer.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        In the same game tree, if Max’s best option is known to be 5 (alpha = 5) and Min discovers a score of 7 in a subtree, Min can prune this branch since 5 < 7, reducing evaluation time.
