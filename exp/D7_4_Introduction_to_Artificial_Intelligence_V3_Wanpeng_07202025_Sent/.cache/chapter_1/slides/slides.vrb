\frametitle{Types of AI - General AI and Superintelligent AI}
    \begin{block}{General AI}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Also referred to as Strong AI, it has the capability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence in any domain.
            \item \textbf{Characteristics}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Can perform any intellectual task that a human can do.
                    \item Ability to reason, solve problems, and comprehend complex ideas.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Current Status}: Theoretical and not yet realized in practice.
            \item \textbf{Example}: OpenAI's GPT-3 showcases elements of General AI by generating human-like text, but true General AI remains unachieved.
        \end{itemize}
