    \begin{block}{Unsupervised Learning}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}
                Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data without labeled responses, allowing the model to identify inherent patterns.

            \item \textbf{Key Characteristics}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Unlabeled Data: No specific outputs are providedâ€”only input data is available.
                    \item Objective: Discover hidden structures within the data.
                \end{itemize}

            \item \textbf{Examples}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Clustering: Grouping similar data points, such as customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
                    \item Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like PCA or t-SNE to reduce dataset dimensions while preserving structures.
                \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Reinforcement Learning}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}
                Reinforcement learning is a paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

            \item \textbf{Key Characteristics}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Agent-Environment Interaction: The agent interacts with its environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
                    \item Objective: Learn a policy that dictates the best action to take in each state to maximize expected reward over time.
                \end{itemize}

            \item \textbf{Examples}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Game Playing: Training an AI to play chess, learning from wins (rewards) and losses (penalties).
                    \item Robotics: Teaching robots to navigate through obstacles by trial and error.
                \end{itemize}

                    [Actions] $\quad$ [Rewards]
                \end{center}
