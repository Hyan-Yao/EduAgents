  % State Value Function Definition and Formula
  \begin{block}{State Value Function (V)}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Definition:} The state value function, denoted as $V(s)$, measures the expected return
      starting from state $s$ and following a specific policy $\pi$ thereafter.
      \item \textbf{Formula:}
      \begin{equation}
        V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R_t \mid S_0 = s \right]
      \end{equation}
      where:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $R_t$ is the reward at time $t$.
        \item $\gamma$ is the discount factor (0 â‰¤ $\gamma$ < 1).
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  % Example for State Value Function
  \begin{block}{Example}
    Consider a game where a player can be in one of three states (A, B, C).
    If the player is in state A and follows policy $\pi$, they expect
    to accumulate an average reward of 5 points over time. Thus,
    $V^\pi(A) = 5$.
