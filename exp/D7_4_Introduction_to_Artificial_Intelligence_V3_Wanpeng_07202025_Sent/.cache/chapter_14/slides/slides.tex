  \frametitle{Key Ethical Principles - Overview}
  % Overview of Fundamental Ethical Principles in AI
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are transforming various aspects of society, necessitating a focus on ethical principles to ensure responsible and just development and implementation. The three core principles highlighted are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fairness}
    \item \textbf{Accountability}
    \item \textbf{Transparency}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Ethical Principles - Fairness}
  % Discussion on Fairness in AI
  \begin{block}{Fairness}
    \textbf{Definition:} Fairness in AI refers to the idea that algorithms should make decisions without bias, ensuring equitable outcomes for all individuals, regardless of race, gender, or socio-economic status.
  \end{block}
  
  \textbf{Illustration:} Consider a hiring algorithm that evaluates job applicants. If the algorithm disproportionately favors candidates of a certain gender or ethnicity, it is deemed unfair. Diverse training data can help mitigate such biases.

  \textbf{Key Point:} Regularly auditing and evaluating AI systems is crucial to identify and correct biases to promote fairness.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Key Ethical Principles - Accountability and Transparency}
  % Discussion on Accountability and Transparency in AI
  \begin{block}{Accountability}
    \textbf{Definition:} Accountability involves assigning responsibility for the outcomes of AI systems. Stakeholders must be answerable for their AI's decisions and impacts.
  \end{block}
  
  \textbf{Example:} If an autonomous vehicle is involved in an accident, questions arise about who is liable: the manufacturer, the software developers, or the vehicle owner. Clear frameworks for liability help establish accountability.

  \textbf{Key Point:} Establishing clear lines of accountability ensures responsible AI development and instills trust.

  \begin{block}{Transparency}
    \textbf{Definition:} Transparency refers to the clarity of AI decision-making processes, allowing users to understand how and why decisions are made.
  \end{block}

  \textbf{Example:} In AI systems for loan approvals, a transparent system would provide insights into approval or denial reasons, avoiding a black-box approach.

  \textbf{Key Point:} Transparency builds trust and enables informed dialogue surrounding AI decisions.
\end{frame}
