**Question 4:** What is a common pitfall when using search algorithms?

  A) Utilizing binary search for sorted data
  B) Assuming linear search is fast for large datasets
  C) Increasing dataset size without algorithm adjustments
  D) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** All of these points describe common pitfalls; linear search is inefficient for large datasets compared to binary search, and assumptions about algorithm performance can lead to inefficiencies.

### Activities
- Implement a function for both Linear Search and Binary Search in Python, and compare their performance on datasets of varying sizes.
- Create a flowchart that illustrates the steps taken by Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search.

### Discussion Questions
- How do you decide which search algorithm to use based on the data you are working with?
- Can you identify a real-world scenario where search algorithms are crucial for success?

## Section 16: Q&A Session

### Learning Objectives
- Encourage student participation and address uncertainties regarding search algorithms.
- Foster an open environment for inquiries and discussions about practical applications and efficiency of search algorithms.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the main purpose of a Q&A session?

  A) To entertain the audience.
  B) To address queries and clarify concepts.
  C) To summarize the entire content.
  D) None of the above.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** A Q&A session aims to address audience queries and clarify any misunderstandings.

**Question 2:** Which search algorithm is more efficient for large datasets?

  A) Linear Search
  B) Binary Search
  C) Depth-First Search
  D) Breadth-First Search

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Binary Search is more efficient for large datasets because it has a time complexity of O(log n) compared to O(n) for Linear Search.

**Question 3:** Which data structure is necessary for a Binary Search to function correctly?

  A) Unsorted Array
  B) Linked List
  C) Sorted Array
  D) Stack

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** A sorted array is necessary for Binary Search to divide the search interval effectively.

**Question 4:** What is the main characteristic of Depth-First Search (DFS)?

  A) It explores all neighbor nodes before moving deeper.
  B) It randomly selects paths.
  C) It explores as far down one branch as possible before backtracking.
  D) It is only used for sorting algorithms.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** DFS explores as far down one branch as possible before backtracking, which is its key characteristic.

### Activities
- Form small groups and choose a search algorithm. Discuss a real-world application and how that algorithm is utilized in that scenario.
- Create a flowchart illustrating the steps of either Binary Search or Depth-First Search. Present your flowchart to the class.

### Discussion Questions
- Can you explain the importance of choosing the right algorithm for different data structures?
- In what situations would a linear search be preferable to a binary search despite its inefficiency?
- What challenges might arise when implementing search algorithms in a programming language of your choice?
