### 2) Data-driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Supplemental Materials**: Introduce consistent foundational workshops or online resources early in the course to build knowledge in AI concepts like search strategies and logic reasoning.

2. **Technical Skills Training**: Implement self-paced tutorials focused on AI libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) at the beginning of the semester, ensuring all students possess the necessary technical skills.

3. **Mathematical Review Sessions**: Offer additional review sessions or online resources emphasizing probability theory and discrete mathematics critical for understanding AI algorithms.

4. **Collaborative Learning Projects**: Design collaborative coding projects or pair programming activities to enhance programming confidence and foster peer learning, allowing students to support each otherâ€™s growth.

5. **Blended Learning Approach**: Transition to a hybrid learning format that integrates self-paced pre-recorded lectures for challenging topics with ample hands-on practice and discussions during live sessions to accommodate diverse learning paces.

6. **Support for Language Needs**: Create clear glossaries of technical terms, and promote formation of study groups or peer support pairs to assist international students in understanding course materials more effectively.

7. **Syllabus Reevaluation**: Consider deepening the coverage of advanced AI topics in response to student requests for more in-depth exploration of areas such as reinforcement learning.

By implementing these targeted adjustments, the course can better serve its diverse student population, ensuring heightened engagement and facilitating the acquisition of essential AI skills.
