    \frametitle{Types of Intelligent Agents - Simple Reflex Agents}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Simple reflex agents act solely based on the current percept, using condition-action rules (if-then statements). They do not maintain any internal state or learn from past experiences.

  \begin{block}{Learning Objectives}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Understand the different types of agent architectures.
      \item Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture.
      \item Apply knowledge to identify suitable architecture based on agent requirements.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Introduction to Agent Architectures}
  An \textbf{agent architecture} serves as the foundation for how an agent behaves and interacts within its environment. It dictates the decision-making processes, planning capabilities, and the overall intelligence of the agent. We can classify agent architectures into four main types:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Deliberative Architectures
    \item Reactive Architectures
    \item Hybrid Architectures
    \item Bottom-Up Architectures
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Deliberative Architectures}
  \begin{block}{Explanation}
    In deliberative architectures, agents operate based on a symbolic representation of the world. They use a knowledge base to plan actions and make decisions through reasoning.
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Involves complex deliberation and reasoning.
    \item Typically includes modules for perception, reasoning, and action.
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Example:} Chess-playing programs that evaluate numerous possible moves and build a strategy.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Reactive Architectures}
  \begin{block}{Explanation}
    Reactive architectures focus on immediate responses to stimuli from the environment without a memory or model of the world. Actions are triggered by perceptual inputs.
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fast response times due to simplicity.
    \item Limited memory or future planning.
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Example:} A simple vacuum cleaning robot that reacts to obstacles in its environment to avoid collisions.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Hybrid Architectures}
  \begin{block}{Explanation}
    Hybrid architectures combine elements of both deliberative and reactive models. They use a mix of decision-making methods, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in various situations.
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Balance between fast reactions and thoughtful planning.
    \item Useful in complex, dynamic environments.
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Example:} An autonomous driving system that reacts to immediate obstacles but also plans a route considering traffic conditions.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Bottom-Up Architectures}
  \begin{block}{Explanation}
    Bottom-up architectures emphasize the development of intelligence from lower-level sensory processing to higher-level cognitive processes. They are often inspired by biological systems.
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Learning and adaptation are prominent aspects.
    \item Focus on emergent behavior rather than pre-defined rules.
  \end{itemize}
  \textbf{Example:} Neural networks used in machine learning that learn from raw sensory data to recognize patterns, like image recognition.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Summary and Future Discussion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Understanding these architectures is crucial for designing intelligent systems.
    \item Each architecture has specific use cases and can be more or less effective depending on the environment and task complexity.
    \item Future discussions will relate how these architectures interact with different agent environments.
  \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Agent Environments - Overview}
    \begin{block}{What are Agent Environments?}
        An agent environment is the external context in which an agent operates. It includes all elements an agent can interact with, such as other agents, physical surroundings, and information resources. 
        Understanding the environment is crucial for designing effective agents.
    \end{block}

            \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Dynamic vs. Static:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Dynamic:} The environment changes while the agent is deliberating.
                      \begin{itemize}
                          \item \textit{Example:} Real-time traffic navigation systems.
                      \end{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Static:} The environment remains constant while the agent acts.
                      \begin{itemize}
                          \item \textit{Example:} Automated assembly lines.
                      \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Understand what performance measures are in the context of agent architectures.
        \item Assess how the rationality of an agent is evaluated based on its performance measures.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Performance Measure - Introduction}
    Performance measures are criteria used to evaluate how well an agent performs its tasks. They serve as benchmarks against which an agent's actions can be assessed for success or failure. 

    A clearly defined performance measure is crucial for determining rationality, indicating whether an agent is acting optimally based on its environment and objectives.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Performance Measure - Key Concepts}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Definition of Performance Measure:} A measure that quantitatively evaluates an agent's actions concerning its goals in a specific environment.
        
        \item \textbf{Types of Performance Measures:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Task-Specific Measures:} Reflect performance related to a specific task (e.g., speed of delivery in a drone).
            \item \textbf{Utility-Based Measures:} Overall performance score based on multiple factors (e.g., cost-efficiency, time, and quality for a manufacturing robot).
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Rationality Assessment:} Rational agents maximize the expected performance measures by using their knowledge for optimal decisions.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Performance Measure - Examples}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Example 1:} A self-driving car's performance could include safe navigation, speed, passenger comfort, and adherence to traffic laws.
        \item \textbf{Example 2:} A chess-playing agent's performance may be measured by the number of games won, opponent skill levels, and move efficiency (time per move).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Performance Measure - Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The design of performance measures significantly impacts an agent's objectives and behaviors.
        \item A poorly designed measure may lead to unintended outcomes, such as compromising safety for speed.
        \item Agents can learn and adapt their performance measures over time, improving rationality and task effectiveness.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Performance Measure - Formula}
    A simple performance measurement formula could be expressed as:
    \begin{equation}
        P = w_1 \cdot m_1 + w_2 \cdot m_2 + ... + w_n \cdot m_n
    \end{equation}
    Where \( P \) is the overall performance score, \( m_i \) are individual metrics (e.g., time, cost, quality), and \( w_i \) are weights reflecting the importance of each metric in the overall evaluation.

        \item \textbf{Rationality is Essential:} Agents must be designed for rational decision-making to optimize interactions.
        \item \textbf{Interconnectivity of Concepts:} The success of intelligent systems relies not only on algorithms but also on ethical frameworks.
        \item \textbf{Future Directions:} Evolving technologies must incorporate diverse architectures with robust decision-making for effective and ethical systems.
