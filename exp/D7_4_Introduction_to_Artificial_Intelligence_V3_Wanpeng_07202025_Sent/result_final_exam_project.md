# Final Project Plan: AI Applications for Ethical Decision-Making

## Project Overview
This project substitutes the traditional final exam by challenging students to create an AI-driven solution to a real-world ethical dilemma in artificial intelligence. Topics may include but are not limited to: algorithmic bias, accountability of AI decisions, and societal impacts of AI technologies. 

## Objectives
1. **Core AI Concepts**: Apply principles of artificial intelligence to evaluate and address ethical challenges in AI.
2. **Algorithm Application**: Design and implement an AI-based solution for analyzing an ethical dilemma with real-world data.
3. **Advanced Problem-Solving Skills**: Leverage deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques to tackle ethical scenarios.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Critically assess the performance of AI models concerning ethical considerations.
5. **Ethical Awareness**: Present findings on the societal implications of AI technologies.
