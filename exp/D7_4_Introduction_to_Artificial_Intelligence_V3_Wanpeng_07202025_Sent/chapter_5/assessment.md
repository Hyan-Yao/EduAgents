### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the primary focus of multi-agent systems?

  A) Maximizing individual agent goals
  B) Cooperative and competitive interaction between autonomous agents
  C) Minimizing resource usage in solitary tasks
  D) Developing algorithms for single-agent environments

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Multi-agent systems focus on the interactions among autonomous agents, highlighting cooperation and competition as key dynamics.

**Question 2:** Which algorithm is commonly used for decision-making in perfect information games?

  A) Alpha-Beta pruning
  B) Simulated Annealing
  C) Particle Swarm Optimization
  D) Genetic Algorithms

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm, designed specifically for perfect information games.

**Question 3:** What does Nash Equilibrium represent in game theory?

  A) The maximum payoff for all agents
  B) A state where no agent benefits from changing their strategy unilaterally
  C) A situation where agents have equal resources
  D) The best possible outcome for a single agent

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Nash Equilibrium signifies a stable state in a competitive environment where no player can improve their payoff by solely changing their strategy.

**Question 4:** What is one of the basic challenges in multi-agent search problems?

  A) Achieving optimal outcomes without time constraints
  B) Coordination among agents and resource management
  C) Developing agent personalities
  D) Minimizing the number of interactions

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Coordination and resource management among multiple agents are critical challenges in multi-agent search problems.

### Activities
- In small groups, brainstorm and present a scenario where multi-agent cooperation could lead to a significant real-world application. Consider both the benefits and potential challenges.

### Discussion Questions
- How might the principles of multi-agent systems be applied to reduce traffic congestion in urban environments?
- What are some potential risks associated with AI agents making autonomous decisions in critical areas such as healthcare or law enforcement?
- Can you provide an example where a lack of cooperation in a multi-agent scenario could lead to failure? How could cooperation have changed the outcome?
