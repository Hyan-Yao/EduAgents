Instructional Goals Definition
==============================

### Learning Objectives for "Foundations of Machine Learning"

1. **Mathematical Foundations**: 
   - By the end of the course, students will explain and apply mathematical concepts such as linear algebra, probability, and statistics in various machine learning contexts.

2. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: 
   - Students will analyze, implement, and present findings on at least two key machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks) through practical assignments and projects.

3. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: 
   - Students will execute data acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing steps, while maintaining a reflective log detailing challenges faced and solutions implemented throughout the process.

4. **Model Evaluation and Validation**: 
   - Students will evaluate model performance using key metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and justify model selection by applying appropriate validation strategies (e.g., cross-validation).

5. **Ethical Considerations in Machine Learning**:
   - Students will critically assess the ethical implications of machine learning applications by engaging in discussions through case studies and debates on topics such as bias and accountability.

6. **Practical Application of Machine Learning Techniques**: 
   - Students will apply machine learning techniques to real-world datasets, demonstrating proficiency in handling both structured and unstructured data.

7. **Collaborative Skills Development**: 
   - Students will work effectively in teams on group projects, demonstrating collaboration skills and the ability to contribute to collective problem-solving in machine learning scenarios.

8. **Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving**: 
   - Students will engage in critical analysis of machine learning problems and propose data-driven solutions, enhancing their problem-solving capabilities through coursework and projects.
