\frametitle{What is Linear Regression? - Example}
    For instance, to predict the price of a car based on its age and mileage, the model might look like:

    \begin{equation}
        \text{Price} = 20,000 - 1,500 \times \text{Age} - 0.05 \times \text{Mileage}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item For every year increase in the car's age, the price decreases by $1,500.
        \item For every mile increase in mileage, the price decreases by $0.05.
    \end{itemize}
