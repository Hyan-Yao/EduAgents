**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** A common proportion for the train/test split in machine learning is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

### Activities
- Students will create a detailed report summarizing a case study of model evaluation in a practical application of their choice (e.g., healthcare, finance, or marketing) and discuss how different evaluation metrics impacted the outcomes.

### Discussion Questions
- What challenges might arise when choosing the appropriate evaluation metric for a given model, and how can they be addressed?
- How do you think continuous improvement in model evaluation influences business strategy and decision-making?

## Section 16: Discussion and Q&A

### Learning Objectives
- Analyze the importance of selecting appropriate model evaluation metrics based on context.
- Apply theoretical knowledge through practical evaluation case studies.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** Which metric is typically favored when false positives are more critical than false negatives?

  A) Accuracy
  B) Precision
  C) Recall
  D) F1-score

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Precision is crucial in scenarios where false positives carry more weight as it measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.

**Question 2:** What is the primary benefit of using k-fold cross-validation?

  A) It uses the entire dataset for training.
  B) It helps mitigate overfitting by validating on multiple datasets.
  C) It simplifies model training.
  D) It guarantees better accuracy.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** K-fold cross-validation divides data into k subsets and allows the model to be trained and validated on different subsets, improving the model's reliability.

**Question 3:** Which of the following indicates a model is underfitting?

  A) High training error and low test error
  B) Low training error and high test error
  C) High training error and high test error
  D) Low training error and low test error

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Underfitting occurs when a model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and test sets.

### Activities
- Form small groups to evaluate a case study where a specific model was chosen based on its evaluation metrics. Discuss the implications of this choice on real-world outcomes.

### Discussion Questions
- What specific challenges have you faced when selecting metrics for your models?
- How can different evaluation methods influence model deployment decisions?
- In your opinion, what should be the primary focus of model evaluation in your industry?
