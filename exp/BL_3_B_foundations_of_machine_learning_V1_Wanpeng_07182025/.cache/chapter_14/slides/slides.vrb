\frametitle{Key Concepts to Review - Part 1}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Core Topics Covered in the Course}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Main Concepts}: Revisit the foundational ideas that have been central to our course discussions.
            \item \textbf{Applications}: Reflect on how these concepts apply to real-world situations and problems.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Algorithms and Techniques}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Brush up on prominent algorithms discussed during the course.
            \item Example: If we discussed sorting algorithms, revisit their complexities (e.g., Quick Sort: average case O(n \log n), best case O(n \log n), worst case O(nÂ²)).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
