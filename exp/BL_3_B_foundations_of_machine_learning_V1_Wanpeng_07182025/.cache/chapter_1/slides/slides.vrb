  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Clustering}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: Clustering groups a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (or cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
        \item \textbf{Popular Algorithms}:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{K-Means Clustering}:
              \begin{enumerate}
                \item Choose the number of clusters \( K \).
                \item Randomly initialize \( K \) centroids.
                \item Assign data points to the nearest centroid.
                \item Update centroids as the mean of assigned points.
                \item Repeat until convergence.
              \end{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Hierarchical Clustering}: Builds a tree of clusters via agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) approaches.
          \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Applications}: Market segmentation, social network analysis, organizing computing clusters.
      \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Association}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: Association rules are used to discover interesting relations between variables in large databases.
        \item \textbf{Popular Algorithm}:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Apriori Algorithm}: Generates frequent itemsets and derives association rules.
          \end{itemize}
          Example Rule: "If a customer buys bread, they are 70\% likely to also buy butter."
        \item \textbf{Applications}: Market basket analysis, recommendation systems, cross-marketing strategies.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
