    \frametitle{Model Evaluation Techniques}
    \begin{block}{Overview of Model Evaluation Metrics}
        When assessing the performance of machine learning models, various metrics provide insights to understand their effectiveness. Here, we will cover four key evaluation metrics: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Accuracy
            \item Precision
            \item Recall
            \item F1-Score
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model Evaluation Metrics - Accuracy}
    \begin{block}{1. Accuracy}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Measures the proportion of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) among the total predictions made.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If a model makes 100 predictions, 70 of which are correct:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Accuracy} = \frac{70}{100} = 0.70 \text{ or } 70\%
            \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Model Evaluation Metrics - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score}
    \begin{block}{2. Precision}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Reflects the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: Identified 30 positive instances, 25 were correct:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Precision} = \frac{25}{30} \approx 0.833 \text{ or } 83.3\%
            \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{3. Recall}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: Measures the ratio of true positive predictions to the actual positives.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If there are 40 actual positive instances and the model correctly identifies 30:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{Recall} = \frac{30}{40} = 0.75 \text{ or } 75\%
            \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{4. F1-Score}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Definition}: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
            \item \textbf{Formula}:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{F1-Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
            \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Example}: If Precision is 0.833 and Recall is 0.75:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{F1-Score} \approx 0.789 \text{ or } 78.9\%

            \item \textbf{Validation Techniques}: Understand techniques like cross-validation for effective validation.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Validation Techniques}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Cross-Validation}: Divides the dataset into k subsets and trains the model k times, each time holding out one subset for validation.
            \item \textbf{Train/Test Split}: The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to gauge model performance on unseen data.
