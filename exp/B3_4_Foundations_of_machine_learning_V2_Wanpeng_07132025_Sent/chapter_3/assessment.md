  A) Data storage
  B) Model implementation
  C) Data visualization
  D) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** After data preprocessing, the next logical step is to implement and evaluate machine learning models.

**Question 2:** Which technique is NOT a part of data preprocessing?

  A) Data cleaning
  B) Feature engineering
  C) Model deployment
  D) Data transformation

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Model deployment is not a data preprocessing technique; it occurs after the model has been built and evaluated.

**Question 3:** Why is data splitting important in machine learning?

  A) To increase the dataset size
  B) To improve data quality
  C) To evaluate model performance objectively
  D) To save time during preprocessing

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Data splitting helps in evaluating model performance objectively and prevents overfitting by ensuring separate data for testing.

**Question 4:** Which preprocessing step would be most useful for handling missing data?

  A) Data normalization
  B) Data cleaning
  C) Feature engineering
  D) Model training

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Data cleaning includes handling missing values which ensures the dataset is accurate and promotes better model performance.
