**Explanation:** Logistic Regression is specifically designed for binary classification problems, where the outcome is categorical.

**Question 2:** What does R-squared represent in regression analysis?

  A) The average prediction error
  B) The proportion of variance explained by the model
  C) The rate of overfitting
  D) The complexity of the model

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** R-squared indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

**Question 3:** What is the main risk of overfitting in regression models?

  A) Model is too simple
  B) Model accurately predicts on new data
  C) Model captures noise instead of the underlying trend
  D) Model cannot generalize to other data sets

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Overfitting occurs when a model captures noise in the data rather than the underlying trend, leading to poor generalization.

**Question 4:** Which of the following is NOT a type of regression mentioned?

  A) Polynomial Regression
  B) Logistic Regression
  C) Ridge Regression
  D) Multiple Regression

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Ridge Regression is a specific type of linear regression that incorporates regularization, not mentioned in the types in the slide.

### Activities
- In small groups, select a real-world problem and create a regression model approach to solving it, considering potential predictors and the type of regression suitable for your dataset.

### Discussion Questions
- What challenges do you foresee when implementing regression in a real-world dataset?
- Discuss how you would select predictors for a regression model in a new project.
