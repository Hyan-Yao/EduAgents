- Engage in open discussions to clarify doubts.
- Encourage collaborative learning through dialogue.
- Illustrate the significance of machine learning in practical scenarios.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is essential for effective discussions in class?

  A) Listening to the instructor only
  B) Open communication and respect
  C) Avoiding asking questions
  D) Only agreeing with others

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Effective discussion relies on open communication and respect among all participants.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is a common machine learning algorithm?

  A) Linear Regression
  B) Bubble Sort
  C) HTML
  D) SQL

**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Linear Regression is an example of a machine learning algorithm often used for prediction tasks.

**Question 3:** What aspect of machine learning allows a model to improve over time?

  A) Overfitting
  B) Generalization
  C) Data Quality
  D) Features

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Generalization refers to the model's ability to perform well on unseen data, improving its prediction capacity over time.

**Question 4:** In the context of machine learning, what does 'overfitting' mean?

  A) The model is too simple to capture the data patterns
  B) The model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
  C) The model processes data too slowly
  D) The model uses too few features

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts its performance on new data.
