    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Diffusion Models}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Description}: New generative models for high-quality data synthesis that can benefit from ensembling.
            \item \textbf{Example}: Averaging outputs from diffusion models achieves refined image generation.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Stacked Generalization}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Description}: Training a new model to combine predictions of base models, leveraging their strengths.
            \item \textbf{Example}: Integrating predictions from decision trees, SVMs, and neural networks enhances accuracy.
