\frametitle{Summary}
    k-NN is a simple yet effective algorithm that relies on the proximity of data points for classification. It applies to various applications, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pattern recognition
        \item Recommendation systems
    \end{itemize}
    \newline
    As you move on to the next slide about \textbf{"How k-NN Works,"} consider these questions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How does changing k affect classification?
        \item What real-world applications can benefit from using k-NN?
    \end{itemize}
