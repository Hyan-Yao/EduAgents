**Question 4:** In a dataset with a large class imbalance, which metric could be misleading if used alone?

  A) Precision
  B) Recall
  C) F1 Score
  D) Accuracy

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** Accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets as it can present a high value even when the model fails to predict the minority class correctly.

### Activities
- Given a confusion matrix of a classification model, calculate the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Discuss the implied strength and weaknesses of the model based on the results.

### Discussion Questions
- How would you decide which metric to prioritize in a specific classification problem?
- Can you think of real-world scenarios where false positives and false negatives may have significantly different implications?
