### 2) Data-Driven Recommendations for Course Adjustments

1. **Revised Learning Objectives:**
   - Align objectives to emphasize data implications and applications in AI, minimizing overwhelming mathematical content.

2. **Syllabus Adjustments:**
   - Focus syllabus on data-centric topics and hands-on applications in AI, connecting course content to student interests.

3. **Integrative Learning:**
   - Implement interactive workshops to enhance tool understanding (e.g., Google Colab), ensuring accessibility for all students, especially those needing guidance.

4. **Support Systems:**
   - Leverage TAs and peer mentors to assist in labs, particularly in the first weeks, to build confidence in programming and machine learning concepts.

5. **Incremental Assessments:**
   - Develop diverse assessment methods, including smaller project milestones and collaborative exercises reflective of real-world scenarios to enhance engagement. 

By implementing these recommendations, the course can be structured to better accommodate the diverse backgrounds and aspirations of its students, enhancing the overall learning experience.
