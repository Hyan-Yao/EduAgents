    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Prediction and Estimation:} E.g., predicting sales based on advertising spend.
        \item \textbf{Understanding Relationships:} How changes in independent variables correlate with changes in the dependent variable.
        \item \textbf{Data-Driven Decision Making:} Informed decisions based on insights from regression analysis.
    \end{itemize}
