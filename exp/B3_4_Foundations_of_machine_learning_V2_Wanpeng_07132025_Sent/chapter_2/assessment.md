**Explanation:** Data sources can primarily be categorized into primary (newly collected) and secondary (existing data).

**Question 3:** How can different data types impact machine learning models?

  A) They require the same preprocessing techniques
  B) They use the same algorithms
  C) They need distinct preprocessing techniques and models
  D) They do not affect the choice of models

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Different data types require distinct preprocessing techniques and models, influencing overall model performance.

**Question 4:** What is a potential challenge when using inappropriate data types?

  A) Improved model accuracy
  B) Effective data visualization
  C) Misleading results
  D) Better model interpretability

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Using an incorrect data type can lead to misleading results and ineffective model performance.

### Activities
- Create a detailed infographic that summarizes different data types, their examples, and preprocessing techniques required for successful machine learning applications.

### Discussion Questions
- How does the choice of data type affect the performance of specific machine learning algorithms?
- In what scenarios might you prefer using secondary data over primary data, and why?
- What steps can be taken to ensure that the primary data collected is of high quality?
