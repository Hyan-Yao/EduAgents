- Reaffirm the importance of clustering in data analysis for improving decision-making.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is a key takeaway regarding the use of clustering methods?

  A) Clustering only applies to structured data
  B) Clustering methods are ineffective for large datasets
  C) Clustering can reveal hidden structures in data
  D) Clustering requires labeled data

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Clustering methods are powerful tools for revealing patterns and structures in unlabeled data.

**Question 2:** Which clustering algorithm is most effective for identifying noise and outliers in a dataset?

  A) K-Means Clustering
  B) Hierarchical Clustering
  C) DBSCAN
  D) Gaussian Mixture Models

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** DBSCAN is designed to identify dense regions in data and effectively handles noise and outliers.

**Question 3:** What type of clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters?

  A) K-Means Clustering
  B) Hierarchical Clustering
  C) Fuzzy C-Means Clustering
  D) Spectral Clustering

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Hierarchical Clustering generates a tree-like structure that represents data at various levels of granularity.

**Question 4:** In which scenario would clustering be particularly useful?

  A) Predicting future sales based on historical data
  B) Classifying emails as spam or not spam
  C) Segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior
  D) Solving a linear regression problem

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Clustering helps identify distinct customer segments, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
