**Explanation:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to work with sequential data by maintaining a memory of previous inputs, making them effective for tasks like language and time series prediction.

**Question 3:** What is the role of backpropagation in neural network training?

  A) To generate new data
  B) To connect neurons
  C) To optimize weights by minimizing the loss function
  D) To visualize data

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Backpropagation is a method used to optimize the weights of a neural network by propagating the error from the output layer back through the network to minimize the loss function.

**Question 4:** What does a Transformer model primarily utilize to process data?

  A) Recurrent connections
  B) Convolutional layers
  C) Attention mechanisms
  D) Simple feedforward connections

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Transformers leverage attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence, allowing for more sophisticated representation of contextual information.
