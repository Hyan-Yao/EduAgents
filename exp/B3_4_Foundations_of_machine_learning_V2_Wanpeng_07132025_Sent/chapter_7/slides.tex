    \frametitle{Introduction to Ensemble Methods}
    \begin{block}{Overview}
        Ensemble methods are powerful techniques in machine learning that combine multiple models to improve predictive performance. Instead of relying on a single learner, ensemble methods merge different models to leverage their strengths, reduce errors, and enhance accuracy.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts - What and Why}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{What are Ensemble Methods?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ensemble methods use a group of models to produce better results than any individual model on its own.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Why Use Ensemble Methods?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Individual models may have biases or limitations, but by combining them, we can mitigate errors and improve predictions.
            \item These methods can capture complex patterns and reduce overfitting by averaging out the noise from individual models.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Real-World Examples of Ensemble Methods}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Voting Classifier:} Imagine a group of friends voting on where to eat dinner. Each friend has a different preference, but collectively, their decision reflects the groupâ€™s consensus, leading to a more favorable outcome.
        
        \item \textbf{Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):} Like asking multiple chefs to prepare their version of a dish and then choosing the best outcome. By training models on different samples of the data, we reduce variance and improve accuracy.
        
        \item \textbf{Boosting:} Think of a student who takes multiple practice exams. Initially, they struggle with some questions, but with each attempt, they focus on their weak areas, gradually improving their overall performance. Boosting sequentially adjusts the focus on challenging instances by giving more weight to previously misclassified data.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Data Sampling:} Creates multiple subsets of the training dataset using bootstrapping (sampling with replacement).
        \item \textbf{Model Training:} Each bootstrap sample is used to train a separate model (e.g., decision trees).
        \item \textbf{Aggregation of Predictions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Classification:} Final prediction via majority voting.
            \item \textit{Regression:} Predictions are averaged.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Example - Random Forests}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Construction:} Builds numerous decision trees using bootstrapped datasets.
        \item \textbf{Feature Selection:} Each tree considers a random subset of features, increasing diversity.
        \item \textbf{Final Prediction:} Combines tree predictions through majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Summary and Key Points}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Diversity is Key:} More diverse individual models enhance overall performance.
        \item \textbf{Complexity vs. Performance:} Balance between model count and computation time is necessary.
        \item \textbf{Use Cases:} Effective for high-variance models like decision trees; stabilizes predictions and enhances performance.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Formula for Overfitting Reduction}
    The reduction in variance can be approximated as:
    \begin{equation}
    \text{Var}(\hat{y}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} + \text{A}^2
    \end{equation}
    where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the model predictions, and $n$ is the number of models. This illustrates how Bagging decreases prediction variance as more models are added.
