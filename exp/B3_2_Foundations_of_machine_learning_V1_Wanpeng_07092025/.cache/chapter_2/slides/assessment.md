**Explanation:** Imputation is a common method used to fill in missing values to retain completeness in the dataset.

**Question 3:** Why is feature engineering important in data preprocessing?

  A) It reduces the number of features.
  B) It creates meaningful variables to enhance model performance.
  C) It increases the computational cost.
  D) It prevents overfitting.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Feature engineering helps create additional relevant features that can improve the predictive power of a model.

**Question 4:** What can happen if inadequate data preprocessing is performed?

  A) Models may work faster.
  B) Models may achieve better accuracy.
  C) Models may exhibit overfitting or underfitting.
  D) Models may require less data.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Poor preprocessing can lead to poor model training, resulting in overfitting or underfitting, negatively affecting performance.

### Activities
- Analyze a provided dataset and identify areas where data preprocessing could significantly impact model performance. Document your findings.
- Select a machine learning project you have studied or been a part of, and create a brief report highlighting the data preprocessing steps taken and their impact on the model's success.

### Discussion Questions
- In your own experience, how has data preprocessing changed the outcomes of machine learning projects?
- What preprocessing techniques do you find most effective and why?
