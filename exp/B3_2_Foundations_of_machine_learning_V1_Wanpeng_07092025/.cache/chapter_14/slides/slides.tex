    \frametitle{Overview of Advanced Topics}
    \begin{block}{Advanced Topics in Machine Learning}
        In this chapter, we will delve into two pivotal aspects of modern machine learning: 
        \textbf{Transfer Learning} and \textbf{Explainability in AI}. 
        Both concepts are essential for building robust AI systems that can be effectively utilized in real-world applications.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{1. Transfer Learning}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Transfer learning is a technique in machine learning where a model developed for a particular task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. 
        This approach is particularly powerful when the second task has limited training data.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Reduced Training Time:} 
            Transfer learning can significantly cut down the time and resources needed to train a model. Instead of training from scratch, we leverage pre-trained models.
        
        \item \textbf{Better Performance with Limited Data:} 
            It helps improve performance when the target domain has few labeled examples.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Image Classification:} 
                Imagine we want to classify images of cats and dogs, but we only have a small dataset. 
                We can take a model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset— which has millions of images—then fine-tune it on our cat and dog dataset. 
                This way, the model retains the knowledge from ImageNet while adapting to our specific classification task.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Adjustment During Fine-Tuning}
    \begin{block}{Illustration}
        Pre-trained Model → Fine-tuned for specific task
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Formula Insight}
        The adjustments made during fine-tuning can often be summarized by minimizing the loss function:  
        \begin{equation}
            \text{Loss} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 
        \end{equation}
        Where \( y_i \) is the true label, and \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted output.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{2. Explainability in AI}
    \begin{block}{Definition}
        Explainability refers to methods and techniques that allow a human to understand and interpret the decisions made by AI systems. 
    \end{block}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Transparency:} 
            Explainable AI promotes transparency in machine learning models, ensuring that stakeholders understand how decisions are made.
        
        \item \textbf{Trust:} 
            By elucidating the reasoning behind predictions (e.g., in healthcare decisions), we can build trust amongst users.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Example}
        In a model predicting loan approvals, it's crucial to reveal factors influencing a denial, such as income level or credit score. Techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can help visualize which features are most important in each prediction.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Why Explainability Matters - Introduction}
    Explainability in Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability to articulate how and why an AI system makes certain decisions. 
    As AI systems become increasingly integrated into critical areas such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, understanding their decision-making processes is crucial. 
    This slide explores the ethical considerations and the pressing need for transparency in AI systems.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Why Explainability Matters - Ethical Considerations}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Accountability}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item AI systems can make decisions that significantly impact individuals and society. 
            \item When outcomes are unfavorable, it's essential to determine who is accountable— the developers, the organizations, or the systems themselves.
            \item \textit{Example:} In a medical diagnosis system, an incorrect prediction might lead to a misdiagnosis. If the model’s reasoning is opaque, it becomes difficult to identify responsibility.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Bias and Fairness}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item AI systems trained on biased data may perpetuate or even exacerbate existing inequalities. 
            \item Understanding how decisions are made can help identify and address potential biases.
            \item \textit{Example:} A hiring algorithm that favors certain demographics over others could reinforce workplace discrimination if its decision-making process is not clear.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Informed Consent}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Users must understand AI systems to provide informed consent for their use.
            \item This is especially critical in sectors like healthcare, where treatments may be guided by AI recommendations.
            \item \textit{Example:} Patients should know how an AI tool determines treatment recommendations to make informed decisions about their health.
        \end{itemize}
