\frametitle{Hierarchical Clustering & DBSCAN}
    \begin{block}{Hierarchical Clustering}
        Builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) by merging or splitting clusters without needing a predefined number of clusters.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Agglomerative}: Start with individual points and merge closest pairs.
            \item \textbf{Divisive}: Start with a single cluster and iteratively split.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{DBSCAN}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Identifies clusters based on the density of points.
            \item Can detect arbitrary-shaped clusters and is robust to noise.
        \end{itemize}
        Key Parameters:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Epsilon ($\epsilon$): Maximum distance between points to be in the same neighborhood.
            \item MinPts: Minimum number of points to form a dense region.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Key Points}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Clustering aids in analyzing unlabeled data.
            \item K-means needs pre-defined clusters; Hierarchical reveals data structure.
            \item DBSCAN is effective for clusters of varying shapes and noise.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
