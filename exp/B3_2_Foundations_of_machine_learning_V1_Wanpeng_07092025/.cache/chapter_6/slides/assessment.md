## Section 16: Conclusion and Recap

### Learning Objectives
- Recap the importance of decision trees and ensemble methods in predictive modeling.
- Summarize key concepts covered regarding the definitions and features of decision trees and ensemble methods.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is a defining feature of decision trees?

  A) They can only handle classification tasks.
  B) They are difficult to interpret.
  C) They are non-parametric and do not assume any distribution for the input data.
  D) They require feature engineering before use.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Decision trees are non-parametric, meaning they do not assume any specific statistical distribution for the input data.

**Question 2:** Which of the following describes an ensemble method?

  A) A single model that works independently.
  B) A combination of multiple models to improve performance.
  C) A method that only uses decision trees.
  D) A technique solely for reducing dataset size.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Ensemble methods combine multiple models to enhance predictive performance, leveraging the strengths of each component.

**Question 3:** What is the primary benefit of using ensemble methods in predictive modeling?

  A) They always reduce computational costs.
  B) They provide a single model for all predictions.
  C) They often outperform individual models by reducing overfitting.
  D) They are only applicable in simple datasets.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Ensemble methods typically outperform individual models by reducing overfitting and improving generalization, especially with complex datasets.

**Question 4:** Which ensemble method focuses on correcting errors of previous models?

  A) Bagging
  B) Boosting
  C) Clustering
  D) Normalization

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Boosting is an ensemble technique that focuses on correcting the errors of previous models by adjusting weights for misclassified instances.

### Activities
- Implement a simple decision tree classifier using a toy dataset and evaluate its performance.
- Create an ensemble model using both bagging and boosting methods on a provided dataset to compare the results.

### Discussion Questions
- Discuss how decision trees can be utilized in various industries. Can you think of an example where decision trees could be particularly useful?
- What advantages and disadvantages do you see in using ensemble methods over individual predictive models?
