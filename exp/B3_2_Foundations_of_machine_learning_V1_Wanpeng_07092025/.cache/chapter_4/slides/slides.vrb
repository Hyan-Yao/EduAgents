\begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{y (Dependent Variable):}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The output or response variable being predicted or explained.
                \item \textit{Example:} In predicting house prices, **y** could be the price of the house.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{m (Slope):}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Represents the change in **y** for a one-unit increase in **x**.
                \item Indicates the strength and direction of the relationship.
                \item \textit{Example:} If **m = 200K**, for every unit increase in **x** (e.g., square footage), **y** increases by $200,000.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{x (Independent Variable):}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The input or predictor variable used to predict the dependent variable.
                \item \textit{Example:} In our housing example, **x** could represent the total square footage of the house.
            \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{b (Intercept):}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The value of **y** when **x** is zero; where the regression line crosses the y-axis.
                \item \textit{Example:} If **b = 100K**, a house with zero square footage would hypothetically have a price of $100,000.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
