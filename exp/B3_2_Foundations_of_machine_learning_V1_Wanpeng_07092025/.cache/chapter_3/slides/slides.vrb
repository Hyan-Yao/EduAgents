\frametitle{Key Points & Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Choosing Methods:}
          Transformation is not one-size-fits-all; select methods based on data distribution and algorithm.

    \item \textbf{Visual Inspection:}
          Always visualize feature distributions before and after transformation.

    \item \textbf{Combining Techniques:}
          Combining transformations may yield better results (e.g., scaling + polynomial features).
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Conclusion}
    Feature transformation is essential for optimizing model performance and effectively capturing underlying data patterns.
