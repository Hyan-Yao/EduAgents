### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the primary purpose of dimensionality reduction?

  A) To increase the number of features in a dataset.
  B) To simplify datasets while preserving essential characteristics.
  C) To enhance the performance of supervised learning algorithms.
  D) To eliminate outliers from the dataset.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Dimensionality reduction aims to simplify datasets by reducing the number of features while retaining essential information, making analysis more manageable.

**Question 2:** Which dimensionality reduction technique is best suited for visualizing high-dimensional data while preserving local structure?

  A) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  B) t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
  C) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  D) Autoencoders

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** t-SNE is specifically designed to preserve local structures in data, making it more effective for visualizing high-dimensional datasets in lower dimensions.

**Question 3:** How can dimensionality reduction enhance clustering algorithms?

  A) By increasing the number of clusters available.
  B) By requiring more computational power.
  C) By improving computational efficiency and detecting meaningful patterns.
  D) By eliminating the need for clustering entirely.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Dimensionality reduction can improve computational efficiency and help clustering algorithms detect useful patterns by simplifying the datasets they work with.

**Question 4:** In the example workflow provided, what is the first step?

  A) Utilize clustering algorithms on the original data.
  B) Apply PCA or t-SNE on the dataset to reduce dimensions.
  C) Analyze clusters using visualization tools.
  D) Assess clusters formed in reduced dimensions.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The first step in the example workflow is to apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE to the dataset.

### Activities
