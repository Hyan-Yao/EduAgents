**Question 2:** Which metric can provide a better measure of model performance on imbalanced datasets?

  A) Accuracy
  B) Precision
  C) Recall
  D) F1 Score

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** The F1 Score balances precision and recall, making it more informative for imbalanced datasets.

**Question 3:** What is a key benefit of using k-fold cross-validation?

  A) It decreases computation time.
  B) It provides a single validation result.
  C) It helps prevent overfitting.
  D) It simplifies the model training process.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** K-fold cross-validation helps assess the model's ability to generalize and reduces the risk of overfitting.

**Question 4:** What does hyperparameter tuning aim to optimize?

  A) The input data
  B) The parameters that govern the training process
  C) The evaluation metrics
  D) The final model output

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Hyperparameter tuning focuses on optimizing pre-defined parameters that influence the training process of the model.
