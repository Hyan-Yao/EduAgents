# Final Project Plan: Real-World Machine Learning Solutions

## Project Overview
In this capstone project, students will collaboratively apply machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem using authentic datasets. The aim is to demonstrate comprehensive knowledge of machine learning concepts, inclusive of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Ethical considerations and the implications of the work will be addressed, promoting critical thinking, applied skills, and teamwork.

## Objectives
1. Identify and define a real-world problem suitable for machine learning solutions.
2. Utilize appropriate datasets to analyze and model the problem.
3. Apply various machine learning methodologies for data analysis.
4. Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.
5. Discuss ethical implications of the chosen problem and solutions.
6. Enhance collaboration and communication skills through teamwork.
