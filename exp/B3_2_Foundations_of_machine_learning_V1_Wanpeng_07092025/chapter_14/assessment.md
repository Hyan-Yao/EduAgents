- Foster critical thinking about the ethical implications of AI in high-stakes environments.

### Assessment Questions

**Question 1:** What is the primary benefit of using transfer learning?

  A) Requires massive amounts of target data
  B) Reduces training time and data requirements
  C) Increases the complexity of the model
  D) Eliminates the need for any preprocessing

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Transfer learning is advantageous because it allows models to leverage knowledge from a related task, thereby reducing the amount of target data and time needed for effective training.

**Question 2:** Which of the following is NOT a method of explainability in AI?

  A) SHAP
  B) LIME
  C) Fine-tuning
  D) Feature Importance

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Fine-tuning is a process in transfer learning, not a method of explainability. SHAP and LIME are techniques that help in interpreting model predictions.

**Question 3:** In which scenario is explainability MOST crucial?

  A) Multiplayer online gaming
  B) Healthcare diagnostics
  C) Movie recommendations
  D) Weather forecasting

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Explainability is critical in healthcare diagnostics because decisions can have significant impacts on patient outcomes, thus requiring transparency and trust.

**Question 4:** Which of the following best describes transfer learning?

  A) Training a model with no data
  B) Applying knowledge from one problem to a different but related problem
  C) Learning only from historical data
  D) Building models from scratch using large datasets

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Transfer learning involves transferring knowledge obtained from solving one problem to assist in solving another related problem, especially when data is limited.

### Activities
- Conduct a group discussion where participants share experiences using transfer learning in their projects and the challenges faced regarding model explainability.

### Discussion Questions
- What are some benefits and limitations of using transfer learning in real-world applications? Consider contexts where the models might fail or succeed.
- How important do you think model interpretability is in high-stakes fields like medicine or criminal justice? Should we prioritize explainability over accuracy in these areas?
- Can you think of scenarios where transfer learning and explainability could synergistically enhance an AI application?
