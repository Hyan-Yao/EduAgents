# Final Project Plan: Collaborative Data Processing at Scale

## Project Overview
The final project for the "Data Processing at Scale" course will focus on developing a data processing pipeline to address a real-world data challenge across various industries, including e-commerce, healthcare, or finance. Students will collaborate in teams to apply course concepts, fostering analytical thinking and practical skills in large-scale data processing.

## Project Objectives
1. Define and scope a real-world data processing challenge.
2. Apply data processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Hadoop/Spark) to construct a scalable data pipeline.
3. Implement performance tuning and data governance principles in project execution.
4. Utilize authentic datasets to drive insights and decision-making.
5. Collaborate effectively and communicate milestones, insights, and deliverables.
