**Welcome to today's session on Data Ingestion Techniques.** We’ll explore why effective data ingestion is critical in data processing frameworks, especially when handling large datasets and ensuring timely access to data.

---

**[Advance to Frame 1]**

On this first frame, we introduce the concept of data ingestion. 

**Data ingestion** is a fundamental process within any data processing framework. It involves collecting, importing, and processing data from various sources into a storage system. This data can then be analyzed and utilized for business insights.

You might wonder, why is data ingestion so critical? Because, effective data ingestion techniques enable organizations to streamline their data workflows. By doing so, they can ensure that high volumes of data are managed efficiently and transformed into actionable insights.

---

**[Advance to Frame 2]**

Now, let’s dive deeper into the **importance of data ingestion**.

Firstly, data ingestion acts as the **foundation for data analytics**. It marks the beginning of the data lifecycle. If data ingestion methods are inadequate, they can introduce delays and inaccuracies in data availability. This, in turn, can adversely affect business outcomes. 

Imagine trying to make business decisions based on outdated or incorrect information—it could lead to costly mistakes! Therefore, reliable data ingestion is essential for timely and informed decision-making.

Next, we have **handling large datasets**. In our modern data landscape—often referred to as big data—we require sophisticated ingestion methods to manage vast and often complex datasets sourced from various mediums like databases, APIs, and IoT devices. Effective data ingestion techniques are designed with scalability in mind, allowing organizations to accommodate growing data volumes without sacrificing performance.

And last but not least, organizations may require both **real-time and batch processing** capabilities. An effective data ingestion strategy must consider this need. For example, for real-time data, using something like Apache Kafka would be appropriate, while traditional ETL processes work well for batch processing. 

---

**[Advance to Frame 3]**

Moving on, let’s examine some **key techniques in data ingestion.**

The first technique is **batch ingestion**. This method collects data over a specific period and processes it as a single unit or batch. An everyday example is end-of-day sales data from a retail store. This information is collected throughout the day and processed each night to update the inventory reports and sales analytics.

On the other hand, we have **stream ingestion**. This technique involves ingesting data in real-time as it is generated. A great example would be the continuous monitoring of website user activity. In this scenario, user interactions are captured instantaneously, allowing businesses to analyze patterns and trends in real-time.

As we discuss these methods, there are some **key points to emphasize**:
1. **Scalability** is crucial. Ingestion methods must be able to grow in tandem with the volume of incoming data.
2. **Flexibility** in choosing between batch and stream processing is of utmost importance, determined by specific use case requirements.
3. Finally, **performance** must not be overlooked. Optimal ingestion methods reduce latency, ensuring that data is accurately captured and accessible.

As we can see, each of these techniques has its unique advantages and applications. 

---

**[Concluding the Slide]**

In conclusion, a robust data ingestion strategy is essential for harnessing the full potential of your data. It enhances data accessibility, improves reliability for analytics and reporting tools, and ultimately enables more insightful, data-driven decisions.

What questions do you have thus far? 

And as we transition into the next slide, we will define data ingestion more clearly and further explore the distinctions between batch and stream ingestion methods.

**Slide Title: Understanding Data Ingestion**

**[Start of Presentation]**

Welcome everyone! In this slide, we’ll delve into the concept of data ingestion and explore its critical role within the broader data lifecycle. Specifically, we’ll differentiate between two primary data ingestion techniques: batch ingestion and stream ingestion. 

Let's start by defining data ingestion.

**[Advance to Frame 1]**

### Definition of Data Ingestion

Data ingestion is essentially the process of obtaining and importing data for immediate use or for storage in a database. This process is critical within the data lifecycle because it enables organizations to gather data from various sources—think sensors, databases, APIs, and even file systems. 

What’s vital to realize is that this foundational step ensures that data is available for analysis and decision-making purposes. Without effective data ingestion, all subsequent data processing and analytics efforts can fall flat. 

To put it simply, think of data ingestion as the initial phase of a recipe where you gather all your ingredients. If you don't have the right ingredients prepared, the cooking process—like data analysis—can't happen effectively. 

**[Advance to Frame 2]**

### Role in the Data Lifecycle

Now, let's discuss the role of data ingestion in the data lifecycle. It encompasses four key stages:

1. **Collection**: This is where data is gathered from various sources. For example, you might pull data from transactional databases or collect streaming data from IoT sensors. 

2. **Storage**: Once data is ingested, it gets stored in data repositories like data lakes or warehouses. This is akin to putting all your ingredients in the pantry after you've collected them. It prepares them for when they are needed next.

3. **Processing**: At this stage, the ingested data is transformed and analyzed to extract meaningful insights. It’s comparable to the cooking phase of our earlier analogy. Just as different cooking techniques can yield different dishes, various data processing techniques can reveal varied insights. 

4. **Consumption**: Finally, the processed data is made accessible to users or applications, allowing for visualization and strategic utilization. It’s similar to serving your dish at the dinner table – it's now ready for your guests to enjoy.

**Key Point:** It’s crucial to highlight here that data ingestion facilitates seamless transitions and operations across all stages of the data lifecycle. Without it, the continuity of data flow is broken.

**[Advance to Frame 3]**

### Types of Data Ingestion

Let’s shift gears and talk about the types of data ingestion. The techniques primarily fall into two main categories: batch ingestion and stream ingestion. 

**1. Batch Ingestion:**
- **Definition**: This method involves collecting and processing data in large chunks at scheduled intervals, like every hour or every day. 
- **Characteristics**:
    - It typically consumes fewer resources since it processes data in bulk.
    - It’s well-suited for historical data analysis and reporting. For instance, a business may generate end-of-day sales reports collected every 24 hours.
    - However, it does have its downsides, such as higher latency due to its scheduled nature.
- **Examples**: Common scenarios include processing financial transactions every hour or gathering customer feedback at the end of each day.

**2. Stream Ingestion:**
- **Definition**: In this approach, data is ingested in real time, processed continuously as it arrives.
- **Characteristics**:
    - This method offers immediate data availability, significantly reducing latency. 
    - It's particularly ideal for time-sensitive applications. 
- **Examples**: Consider monitoring social media feeds for brand mentions in real-time or real-time fraud detection during transactions as they happen.

Now, think about how choosing the wrong ingestion method could impact a business. If a retail company waits for nightly batch processing for real-time inventory tracking, they might miss out on sales opportunities. 

**[Advance to Frame 4]**

### Key Takeaway: Batch vs. Stream Ingestion

A succinct summary table here can serve to contrast these two methods visually. 

| Feature                    | Batch Ingestion                       | Stream Ingestion           |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Process Type**           | Scheduled batches                     | Continuous stream          |
| **Latency**                | Higher (depends on schedule)         | Lower (real-time)         |
| **Use Case**               | Historical analysis                   | Real-time analytics        |
| **Resource Consumption**   | Optimized per batch                   | Ongoing processing         |

This table captures the essence of the differences quite neatly. As you can see, while batch ingestion is great for processing large amounts of data at once, stream ingestion allows for continuous data flow and instant decision-making.

**[Advance to Frame 5]**

### Conclusion

To wrap up, it's important to remember that data ingestion goes beyond being a mere technical necessity. It plays a strategic role in data-driven decision-making. By understanding the different techniques available—batch and stream ingestion—data practitioners can optimize their workflows and fully leverage the potential of their data.

Are there any questions about the data ingestion process or how it fits into the overall data lifecycle? 

Thank you for your attention! I look forward to our next discussion, where we will explore various data ingestion methods, such as API-based ingestion and the role of message brokers, in more detail.

## Section 3: Data Ingestion Methods
*(4 frames)*

**Speaking Script for "Data Ingestion Methods" Slide**

---

**Opening the Slide:**
“Now that we’ve laid the groundwork for understanding data ingestion, let's delve into the various methods available for ingesting data into systems. This week, our focus is on the fundamentals of data ingestion and the specific approaches you can take to ensure efficient data handling in your projects. On this slide, we will explore three primary data ingestion methods: API-based ingestion, message brokers, and direct file uploads. Let’s start by defining data ingestion.”

---

**Frame 1: Overview of Data Ingestion Methods**
"Firstly, data ingestion is the process of obtaining and importing data for immediate use or storage in a database. This is a vital step in data management, as how we acquire our data affects everything from its quality to its timeliness. Understanding the various methods of data ingestion is crucial for ensuring that data is obtained in the most efficient and effective manner possible.

By familiarizing ourselves with the different ingestion methods, we equip ourselves to design robust data pipelines that can handle various data formats, volumes, and use cases. 

With this context in mind, let’s explore each method in detail, starting with API-based ingestion. Please advance to the next frame."

---

**Frame 2: API-Based Ingestion**
“API-based ingestion involves using APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, to retrieve data. APIs serve as bridges for applications, allowing them to communicate with one another and share data efficiently. RESTful and SOAP APIs are two common types used for this purpose.

The ideal situations for API-based ingestion include scenarios that require real-time data access and integration with third-party services. For example, consider a marketing team that needs to pull in social media metrics from a CRM application. Using the exposed REST API, they can automate the retrieval of that data, saving time and reducing manual effort.

To illustrate this, let’s have a look at a Python code snippet that accomplishes this task. The code uses the `requests` library to send a GET request to retrieve customer data. 

```
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/customers')
data = response.json()
```

This snippet demonstrates how easily data can be accessed programmatically. The benefits of API-based ingestion are significant. It enables real-time updates, reduces the need for manual uploads, and ensures that the data remains current, which is crucial for data-driven decision-making.

Now that we have covered API-based ingestion, let’s move on to our second method, message brokers."

---

**Frame 3: Message Brokers and Direct File Uploads**
“Message brokers are middleware tools designed to facilitate the exchange of information between applications. They act as intermediaries that manage communication between data producers, like sensors or applications that generate data, and data consumers, which process that data.

Popular tools you might encounter include Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ. These tools are particularly effective when handling high-throughput scenarios, such as telemetry data coming from IoT devices. 

For example, data collected from networked sensors can be pushed to a message broker like Kafka, which then efficiently distributes this data to various applications for real-time processing.

The benefits of using message brokers are clear. They ensure that our systems are decoupled, thus allowing services to evolve independently, they can buffer incoming messages to handle bursts of data, and they provide the scalability necessary to process large datasets.

Next, we’ll talk about direct file uploads. This method involves uploading data files—like CSV or JSON—directly into your storage systems or databases. It’s a straightforward technique often used in batch processing where data is collected over specific periods and uploaded at scheduled intervals.

A common use case might involve an analyst who uploads monthly sales data into a data warehouse via FTP—this is a classic case of leveraging direct file uploads for periodic transfers.

The benefits here are also notable: the implementation is simple, it supports the transfer of large files, and it fits perfectly into batch workflows, which many organizations rely upon.

That leads us to the various factors to consider when choosing the right method of data ingestion, so let's advance to the final frame."

---

**Frame 4: Key Points to Emphasize**
"To wrap up our discussion on data ingestion methods, let's highlight a few key points.

First, there's flexibility. Each ingestion method serves different operational needs, and knowing when to use each one can greatly impact your data integration processes.

Second, effective ingestion lays the groundwork for seamless integration within ETL processes and analytics. It’s all about ensuring that data flows smoothly and can be transformed and loaded effectively.

Finally, when choosing the right method for your needs, consider factors like data volume, the speed at which you need the data (also known as data velocity), and how fresh that data needs to be. By keeping these criteria in mind, you can make better decisions that will improve your data workflows.

As we move forward in this course, the knowledge of these various data ingestion methods will empower you to design more effective data integration solutions, preparing you well for real-world data challenges.

Next, we will explore popular data ingestion tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Nifi, and AWS Glue. We’ll discuss their applications, advantages, and how to integrate them into your data workflows effectively. Let’s keep this momentum going!”

## Section 5: Implementing ETL Processes
*(5 frames)*

Sure! Here’s a detailed speaking script designed to accompany the slide on "Implementing ETL Processes." It will guide you through each point, provide smooth transitions between frames, and engage the audience effectively.

---

**[Begin with a smooth transition from the previous slide]**

"As we wrap up our discussion on the various tools for data ingestion, let's delve into the core processes that facilitate effective data handling: the Extract, Transform, and Load—commonly known as ETL processes. 

**[Advance to Frame 1]**

On this slide, titled *Implementing ETL Processes*, we will explore how these processes play a critical role in ingesting data and preparing it for analysis, ensuring that the raw data we collect becomes valuable and actionable.

**[Pause briefly for the audience to absorb the title]**

ETL is not just a set of tasks; it is a foundational concept in data management. So, let's start by breaking this down.

**[Advance to Frame 2]**

First, the **Extract** phase. This is where the journey begins. 

- **Definition**: In this phase, we retrieve data from various sources. These sources can include databases, APIs, or even flat files. 
- For example, imagine pulling customer data from a CRM system or fetching sales data from an e-commerce platform. 

These examples highlight the diversity of data sources we might encounter. 

**[Rhetorical question to engage the audience]** 
"Can anyone think of other data sources we might need to consider?" 

**[Pause for responses]**

It's crucial to note that the sources we deal with can be structured, like SQL databases, or unstructured, such as CSV files. 

Additionally, we might need to decide between handling data in real-time or doing it in batch mode. The choice here can affect how promptly we can make decisions based on the data we extract.

**[Advance to Frame 3]**

Now, moving on to the **Transform** phase. This is where the magic happens. 

- **Definition**: In this phase, we process the data to convert it into a useful format. 
- There are several transformations we may apply. 

For instance:
- **Data Cleaning**: This involves removing duplicates and correcting inconsistencies. 
- **Data Enrichment**: Here, we might add additional fields—like geographic information to customer records, making our data much richer. 
- **Aggregation**: An example would be summarizing data, such as calculating total sales per month.

These transformation activities not only enhance the data’s quality but also ensure that it maintains integrity. 

**[Engagement point]**
"Think about how a poorly transformed dataset could lead to questionable insights. How vital is quality at this stage?" 

**[Pause for responses]**

In essence, this transformation aligns our datasets for meaningful analysis and decision-making.

**[Advance to Frame 4]**

Next, we arrive at the **Load** phase. 

- **Definition**: This final stage of the ETL process involves moving the transformed data to a target system, typically a data warehouse or data mart.
- An example would be loading processed sales data into Amazon Redshift, where it can be accessed for analytical queries.

In this phase, we also need to consider our loading strategy. Should we do a **full load**, where we move all data, or an **incremental load**, where we only transfer new or updated data?

The chosen strategy has significant implications for the speed and efficiency of our data accessibility. 

**[Pause to let this sink in]**

Ultimately, effective loading ensures that the data is available for business intelligence tools and analytics, making it a critical step in the ETL process.

**[Advance to Frame 5]**

Now let's examine how ETL integrates into our data ingestion efforts. 

- ETL acts as the backbone of efficient data pipelines, enabling systematic data movement. 
- Many data ingestion tools, such as Apache Kafka or AWS Glue, incorporate ETL processes within their workflows. This integration helps streamline data processing, allowing organizations to benefit from timely insights.

What are some other benefits of ETL that we should consider? 

- It ensures data accuracy and quality, which are paramount in any analytics initiative.
- It facilitates timely and efficient data analysis by transforming data into a usable format quickly.
- And ultimately, it supports better decision-making with clean, structured datasets.

To visualize this entire process at a high level, we can consider a simple diagram:

```
[Data Sources] --> [Extract] --> [Transform] --> [Load] --> [Data Warehouse]
```

This diagram encapsulates the flow from data collection to its eventual storage in a data warehouse.

**[Wrap Up the Presentation]**

In conclusion, by understanding ETL processes within the broader context of data ingestion, you will be better equipped to design, implement, and manage effective data pipelines tailored to your organization's unique data needs.

**[Engagement point for future learning]**
As you think about these processes, I encourage you to familiarize yourself with common ETL tools discussed in the previous slide. They are invaluable resources in real-world applications.

Thank you for your focus during this segment. Let's now look into the challenges that data ingestion poses for scalability, particularly strategies like horizontal scaling and how a fault-tolerant architecture can bolster our growing data needs."

## Section 6: Scalability in Data Ingestion
*(5 frames)*

Sure! Here's a detailed speaking script designed to accompany the slide titled "Scalability in Data Ingestion." It will guide you through each point, provide smooth transitions between frames, and engage your audience effectively.

---

**Speaking Script for the Slide: Scalability in Data Ingestion**

---

**[Start of Presentation]**

Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Today, we're delving into an important topic in data management—**Scalability in Data Ingestion**. As organizations increasingly rely on data for decision-making, the ability to effectively scale our data ingestion processes becomes crucial. Let's explore some key concepts, challenges, and strategies in this area.

---

**[Frame 1: Understanding Scalability in Data Ingestion]**

First, let’s begin with understanding **scalability** itself. Scalability in data ingestion refers to the capability of a system to handle growing amounts of data efficiently without sacrificing performance. 

Imagine a large financial institution that processes millions of transactions every second. If their data ingestion system falters, it could lead to delays and inaccuracies, ultimately impacting their service quality. Hence, as organizations accumulate vast volumes of data, it’s essential that our ingestion processes are equipped to scale effectively to meet these demands.

---

**[Transition to Frame 2: Key Challenges in Data Ingestion]**

Now that we’ve set the stage, let's discuss some **key challenges** we face in achieving scalability in data ingestion.

**[Frame 2: Key Challenges in Data Ingestion]**

1. **Volume Growth:** 
   First and foremost, we have the challenge of volume growth. As data increases, so does the need for higher throughput without introducing latency. For instance, as I mentioned earlier, a financial analytics company may process millions of transactions per second. How do we ensure that their ingestion processes can handle this volume without delay?

2. **Diverse Data Sources:**
   Next is dealing with diverse data sources. Data is generated from various sources—APIs, databases, IoT devices—creating a mixed bag of structures and formats. Ensuring uniformity and efficiency across the ingestion pipeline becomes a real challenge. Have any of you dealt with integrating various data sources? It can be quite a headache!

3. **Latency Requirements:**
   Lastly, we have the issue of latency. In many real-time applications, such as fraud detection, immediate data ingestion is crucial. But, as we try to scale up real-time systems, they can become complex and difficult to manage effectively.

---

**[Transition to Frame 3: Strategies for Scalability]**

So, how do we approach these challenges? Let's move to the **strategies** for scalability.

**[Frame 3: Strategies for Scalability]**

1. **Horizontal Scaling:**
   One powerful strategy is **horizontal scaling**. This involves adding more machines or nodes to distribute the data ingestion load. For example, consider a web application that collects user behavior data. If one server becomes overwhelmed, we can add additional servers to share the workload. This approach not only maintains performance but also ensures the system is resilient under heavy loads. A great technology to leverage for this is Apache Kafka, which supports a distributed architecture, allowing multiple producers and consumers to work concurrently. 

2. **Fault-Tolerant Architecture:**
   Another essential strategy is implementing a **fault-tolerant architecture**. This design ensures that the system remains reliable and available, even if some components fail. A good example is a data ingestion pipeline that replicates incoming data across multiple nodes. If one node fails, another can seamlessly take over, minimizing disruptions.

   Utilizing frameworks like Apache Flink or Spark can help here because they come with built-in fault tolerance. This ensures that data is not lost and can be recovered, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity.

---

**[Transition to Frame 4: Key Points to Emphasize]**

Now that we've covered some strategies, let’s round out with a few **key points to emphasize**.

**[Frame 4: Key Points to Emphasize]**

- **Design for Growth:** It's vital to always plan for future increases in both data volume and variety. We need to ask ourselves: Are we designing our systems with growth in mind?

- **Monitor and Optimize:** We must regularly assess our ingestion architecture. Are we effectively handling the load? What optimizations can we implement for better performance?

- **Leverage Cloud Solutions:** Finally, don’t overlook cloud solutions. Services like AWS Kinesis or Google Cloud Pub/Sub inherently offer scalability features and managed infrastructure, allowing us to focus more on the business logic rather than the underlying architecture.

---

**[Transition to Frame 5: Conceptual Diagram for Horizontal Scaling]**

To illustrate these concepts visually, let’s look at a **conceptual diagram** that demonstrates basic horizontal scaling.

**[Frame 5: Conceptual Diagram for Horizontal Scaling]**

In this diagram, you can see the flow from **data sources** through a **load balancer** to multiple ingestion nodes—which have a fault-tolerant design—and finally to the **data storage or processing layer**. Each component plays a critical role in ensuring that our data ingestion architecture is robust and capable of scaling. 

The block below the diagram summarizes the flow: **Data Sources to Load Balancer to Multiple Ingestion Nodes (with Fault Tolerance) and finally to Data Storage/Processing Layer**. It highlights the systematic approach we can take in implementing horizontal scaling.

---

**[Closing Remarks]**

In conclusion, by understanding the challenges and implementing these strategies, organizations can ensure that their data ingestion processes are scalable, efficient, and resilient. As you carry forward your own projects, consider how these concepts might apply. 

Are there any questions or thoughts on how you've approached data ingestion in your own experiences?

## Section 7: Data Ingestion Patterns
*(5 frames)*

Certainly! Below is a comprehensive speaking script tailored for the slide content titled "Data Ingestion Patterns." This script thoroughly addresses each frame, ensuring smooth transitions and engagement with the audience.

---

**Slide Title: Data Ingestion Patterns**

Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! In this section, we'll analyze common ***data ingestion patterns***, specifically focusing on Change Data Capture (CDC), event-driven ingestion, and scheduled ingestion. Understanding these patterns is crucial for building efficient data pipelines and ensuring timely data availability. So, let’s dive in!

---

**[Switch to Frame 1]**

First, let's set the stage with a brief overview. Data ingestion is essentially the process of collecting and importing data for immediate use or storage in a data repository. Why is this important? Well, the way we ingest data can significantly affect how effectively we can process and utilize it. By understanding different ingestion patterns, organizations can optimize their data pipelines which in turn enhances system performance and availability.

On this slide, we will explore three common data ingestion patterns:
- Change Data Capture (CDC)
- Event-Driven Ingestion
- Scheduled Ingestion

Now, let’s start with our first pattern!

---

**[Switch to Frame 2]**

Here we have **Change Data Capture (CDC)**. This strategy captures changes made to the data within a database and propagates those changes downstream. Think of it as a watchful guardian, ensuring that all systems remain synchronized with the latest data modifications. 

So, how does CDC work? It monitors database logs to identify any insertions, updates, or deletions that occur. Instead of transferring the entire dataset, which can be quite burdensome, CDC only transmits the changed records. This is significant because it reduces the load on both the network and storage — essentially making the process more efficient.

For instance, imagine you’re using an e-commerce application where order statuses frequently change. As soon as an order is marked as shipped, CDC captures that change and sends it to the analytics database. This ensures that there’s near-real-time visibility into order statuses, which is crucial for both customers and business operations. 

Let’s consider the key points to remember about Change Data Capture:
- It allows for ***real-time updates***, ensuring data is current across connected systems.
- It increases ***efficiency*** because it minimizes the data transferred during updates.
- Common use cases include data warehousing, analytics, and replication within organizations.

With CDC, businesses can ensure that data remains accurate and up-to-date without bogging down their systems with unnecessary data traffic.

Now, let’s move on to our second pattern: **Event-Driven Ingestion**. This method involves ingesting data in direct response to events occurring in real-time. It's highly beneficial for applications that require immediate processing whenever an event happens.

So, how does this work? Data producers, such as IoT devices or user actions, generate events. These events are then collected and processed by an event bus, like Apache Kafka, which directs these events for further action or storage. 

To illustrate, let’s take a stock trading platform as an example. Each time there’s a trade or a price change, an event is produced. This event triggers algorithms that can execute real-time analytics, possibly flagging profitable trades or notifying users of significant market changes.

Here are the key points regarding event-driven ingestion:
- It allows for ***immediate processing*** of data as soon as an event occurs.
- It’s highly ***scalable***, capable of handling large volumes of events efficiently.
- Common use cases include real-time analytics, alerts, and fraud detection.

In environments where decisions must be made quickly, event-driven ingestion is invaluable!

**[Switch to Frame 4]**

Next, let’s discuss **Scheduled Ingestion**. Unlike the previous patterns, this approach collects and imports data at regular intervals. It’s ideal for scenarios where real-time updates are not critical.

How does it work? A scheduling tool, often a cron job, orchestrates data pulls from the source to the destination at defined intervals such as hourly or daily. This type of ingestion is beneficial for processing batches of data rather than dealing with the constant influx of updates.

For example, a financial institution might adopt scheduled ingestion to aggregate daily transaction data from multiple branches overnight. Doing this allows them to generate reports for the next business day promptly.

Key points about scheduled ingestion include:
- It provides ***predictable loads***, allowing for better management of system resources during ingestion.
- It is efficient for ***batch processing***, especially in situations where immediate data is not necessary.
- Common use cases include reporting, backups, and periodic analytics.

In environments where a steady stream of data isn't critical, scheduled ingestion helps streamline operations without overwhelming resources.
