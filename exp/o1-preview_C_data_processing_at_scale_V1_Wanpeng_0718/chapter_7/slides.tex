    \frametitle{What is Data Governance?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Definition}: Data Governance refers to the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used in an organization.
        \item \textbf{Key Principles}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Accountability}: Establishing clear roles and responsibilities for data management.
            \item \textbf{Quality}: Ensuring data is accurate, consistent, and reliable.
            \item \textbf{Security}: Protecting data from unauthorized access and breaches.
            \item \textbf{Compliance}: Adhering to laws and regulations governing data usage.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Example}
        A national healthcare provider implements a data governance framework to ensure patient records are accurate, secure, and accessible only to authorized personnel.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Principles of GDPR - Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency}
    \begin{block}{Core Aspects}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Lawfulness}: Data processing must have a valid legal basis, such as consent or necessity for contract performance.
            \item \textbf{Fairness}: Organizations must process data in ways individuals would reasonably expect.
            \item \textbf{Transparency}: Individuals must be informed about how their data is being collected and used.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \textbf{Example:} If a user signs up for a newsletter, the organization must clearly state how their email will be used and any third parties involved.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Principles of GDPR - Purpose Limitation and Data Minimization}
    \begin{block}{Purpose Limitation}

    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Data Minimization}
        Only data necessary for the intended purpose should be collected. Organizations should avoid collecting excessive data.
    \end{block}
    \textbf{Example:} When providing a service, collect only essential information like name and email, not additional data like age and gender unless required.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Principles of GDPR - Accuracy and Storage Limitation}
    \begin{block}{Accuracy}
        Data must be accurate and kept up to date. Organizations are responsible for rectifying or deleting inaccurate personal data without delay.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Storage Limitation}
        Personal data should be retained only as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. 
    \end{block}
    \textbf{Example:} A customer’s information should be kept only as needed for a transaction and deleted securely after a certain period, such as 2 years.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Principles of GDPR - Integrity and Accountability}
    \begin{block}{Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)}
        Adequate security measures must be in place to protect personal data from unauthorized access, loss, or damage.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Accountability}
        Organizations must demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles, keeping detailed records of data processing activities.
    \end{block}
    \textbf{Key Point:} Accountability emphasizes the need for comprehensive data governance frameworks.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Principles of GDPR - Rights of Data Subjects}
