    \frametitle{Introduction to Performance Tuning}
    \begin{block}{What is Performance Tuning?}
        Performance tuning in distributed systems refers to the systematic optimization of system performance to increase efficiency and reduce response times for data processing tasks. This involves analyzing various components of the system to identify bottlenecks, inefficient resource usage, and latency issues.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Importance of Performance Tuning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Efficiency}: Enhances system utilization, allowing for greater throughput and maximizing resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O).
        \item \textbf{Scalability}: Ensures that the system can handle increased loads or larger datasets without significant degradation of performance.
        \item \textbf{Cost Reduction}: Optimized systems can reduce operational costs by minimizing resource waste, such as reducing cloud service expenses.
        \item \textbf{User Experience}: Faster response times improve overall user satisfaction, critical in applications where latency can affect service delivery.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Concepts in Performance Tuning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Bottlenecks}: Identify parts of the system that slow down overall performance (e.g., network bandwidth, disk I/O, CPU overload).
        \item \textbf{Load Balancing}: Distributing workloads evenly across servers to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck.
        \item \textbf{Caching}: Storing copies of frequently accessed data in memory to reduce access times compared to querying databases.
        \item \textbf{Parallel Processing}: Breaking down tasks into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed concurrently, significantly speeding up data processing.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Example: Tuning a Distributed Database}
    Consider a distributed database handling millions of queries per day. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Problem}: Users report slow response times.
        \item \textbf{Tuning Actions}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Optimize Query Plans: Use indexes to speed up query execution.
            \item Implement Caching: Store the result of frequently executed queries in memory.
            \item Adjust Replica Placement: Ensure read replicas are geographically closer to users to reduce latency.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Key Strategies for Optimizing Algorithms - Part 1}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Algorithm Choice and Complexity:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Selecting the right algorithm based on time and space complexity is crucial.
            \item Example: Prefer an O(n log n) sorting algorithm like Merge Sort over an O(n²) algorithm like Bubble Sort for large datasets.

        \item \textbf{Efficient Data Structures:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Utilizing suitable data structures can drastically reduce time complexity.
            \item Example: A Hash Table can provide average O(1) complexity for lookups compared to O(n) for a list.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Lazy Evaluation:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Delay the evaluation of expressions until their values are required to avoid unnecessary computations.
            \item Example: In languages like Haskell, lazy evaluation allows constructing infinite lists without computing all values upfront.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Memoization and Caching:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Cache results of expensive function calls and reuse the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
            \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
            \end{lstlisting}
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Batch Processing:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Instead of processing data in real-time, accumulate data in batches for more efficient processing.
            \item Example: In data pipelines, read and process data in chunks rather than item-by-item to reduce overhead.
